DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD)
JOINT SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAM (SAP) IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE (JSIG)
11 April 2016
NOTE:
This version of the JSIG is based on NIST SP 800-53, Rev 4 and CNSSI 1253, March 2014.
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-1
PREFACE
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a framework designed to be tailored to meet organizational
needs while providing adequate risk management of data and information systems. Transformation to the
RMF is a daunting task and we appreciate all the effort to date within the Department and Industry. We
applaud all the hard work of the Joint SAP Cybersecurity Working Group (JSCS WG) and the spectacular
leadership of the individuals who created this joint “coalition of the willing.”
Special Access Programs represent some of the Department’s most sensitive information and must be
protected accordingly. We can no longer rely on physical isolation as a primary risk mitigation strategy.
Threats and risks often outpace our ability to implant robust, multi-disciplinary countermeasures. Cost
and timelines to develop threats to our data almost always pale to the cost and time to implement
countermeasures. Given the rapid increase in cybersecurity threats and prioritization from the SECDEF,
the senior cybersecurity professionals responsible for authorizing information systems to process SAP
have identified three security controls which offer mitigations so significant they can no longer be
tailored. Beginning in this revision of the JSIG, we are introducing controls that are not tailorable.
Historically, the ability to tailor controls has been delegated to the field but senior leadership is no longer
willing to accept the risk of high volume data loss. Recognizing there may be extreme situations in which
it is not feasible to implement these controls in their entirety, the authority to tailor or modify these
controls is delegated to the component SAP senior authorizing official. This waiver authority cannot be
further delegated. The establishment of a senior authorizing official for each DoD component will elevate
the status of cybersecurity functions so they more effectively influence department-wide strategy, policy,
and investments.
Summary of Changes:
• Establishment of Component SAP Senior Authorizing Officials
o Each DoD component responsible for authorizing SAP information systems, shall assign
in writing a SAP Senior Authorizing Official for the component. This SAP Senior
Authorizing Official shall be the waiver authority for “non-tailorable controls.” This
authority cannot be delegated. Waivers to these controls will be submitted to the DoD
SAPCO and DoD SAP CIO within 30 days of approval.
• Establishment of non-tailorable controls
o See AC-6(1), Least Privilege | Authorize Access to Security Functions
 System endpoint protection shall not be tailored out.
o See SA-22,Unsupported System Components
 Added to the baseline and required to be implemented on all SAP systems.
o See SC-28, Protection of Information at Rest
 Encryption of data at rest shall be implemented for all SAP systems.
• The entirety of this document is effective immediately.
Policy
The policy of the U.S. Government is that all classified information be appropriately safeguarded to
assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information. This document provides
standardized security policies and procedures for use in the management of all networks, systems, and
components under the purview of the Department of Defense (DoD) Special Access Program Central
Office (SAPCO) and DoD Service/Agency SAPCOs. This guidance applies to the DoD SAP Community
and all networks, information systems, weapon systems, and applications for which the cognizant SAP
Authorizing Official (AO) has management or oversight responsibility, regardless of the physical
location.
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-2
Responsibilities
The Joint SAP Cybersecurity Working Group (JSCS WG) is chartered to provide DoD SAP cybersecurity
implementation guidance. The JSCS WG provides organizations within the DoD SAP Community a
forum to address all aspects of cybersecurity. JSCS WG functions and activities related to RMF include:
• Promote DoD SAP Community coordination in methodologies for assessing and authorizing
SAP information systems and related areas (e.g., documentation, tools, assessment methods,
processes) to provide for consistency in methodologies, approaches, templates, and
organization-defined values across the DoD SAP Community
• Develop, maintain, and periodically update the policies and procedures related to RMF to
include, as needed, JSIG, security control overlays, RMF training, templates, and other
supporting documentation
• Promote, review, and update training and awareness objectives, material, and availability for all
service, agency, and industry partners on cybersecurity, emphasizing insider threat, community
best practices, and RMF
Additional information on roles and responsibilities related to the Risk Management Framework can be
found in Section 1.5.
Effective Date
This document is effective immediately and organizations should begin tracking the changes from the
Revision 3 to Revision 4 security controls (new, modified and deleted) in an information system
POA&M, with a focus on the three non-tailorable controls identified above. Components may also
provide additional transition guidance.
This document must be reissued, cancelled, or certified current within 5 years of its publication to be
considered current. ·

1 INTRODUCTION AND ROLES
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The DoDM 5205.07, Volume 1, Special Access Program (SAP) Security Manual: General Procedures,
provides policy, guidance, and standards for the authorization of information systems and application of
RMF within a DOD SAP. OSD Memorandum for Special Access Program Senior Working Group
Members, Subject: Transition to the Risk Management Framework, dated December 18, 2013, provides
guidance to assist the DoD SAP Community in meeting congressionally mandated implementation
guidelines in the transition from Joint Air Force – Army – Navy (JAFAN) 6/3 Manual, Protecting Special
Access Program Information within Information Systems to RMF.
The documents having a key role in the assessment and authorization of DoD SAP information systems
include:
• DoDD 5205.07, Special Access Program (SAP) Policy
• DoDM 5205.07 SAP Security Manual:
o Volume 1 (V1) General Procedures
 Reference Enclosure 6, Cybersecurity
o Volume 2 (V2) Personnel Security
o Volume 3 (V3) Physical Security
o Volume 4 (V4) Marking
• NIST Special Publications (SP) Joint Task Force (JTF) Initiative documents:
o NIST SP 800-53, Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations
o NIST SP 800-53A, Revision 4, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal
Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans
o NIST SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach
o NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
Information System View
o NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
• CNSSI 1253, Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security Systems,
March 27, 2014
• Joint SAP Implementation Guide (JSIG)
• DoD 8570.01-M Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program or its replacement based
on DoDD 8140.01, Cyberspace Workforce Management
RMF provides organizations with a disciplined, structured, flexible, and repeatable process for managing
risk related to the operation and use of information systems (IS). The CNSS describes information
system security categorization and security controls selection for National Security Systems (NSS). The
DoD is ensuring that its policies and procedures comply with the CNSS standards (e.g., CNSSI 1253)
allowing the DoD SAP Community to more efficiently support reciprocity.
DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5205.11, Management, Administration, and Oversight of DoD Special Access
Programs (SAPs) requires that elements of the DoD SAP Community establish, publish, issue, and
promulgate information technology (IT) risk management standards for the DoD SAP Community. The
RMF and applicable standards, policies, and guidelines published by NIST and CNSS support this
instruction.
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-11
1.2 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this document is to provide policy and guidance on the implementation of the RMF. This
document, the JSIG, serves as a technical supplement to NIST SP 800-53 and CNSSI 1253, and is used in
concert with the applicable volume of DoDM 5205.07 in the application of the RMF. JSIG provides
standardized cybersecurity/information assurance-related policy, procedures, and implementation
guidance for use in the management of all networks, systems, and system components at all classification
levels under the purview of the cognizant SAP Authorizing Official (AO). These policies and procedures
adhere to applicable laws, Executive Orders (EO), directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
guidance.
The security policy and procedures contained in this document are intended for use by all personnel with
a responsibility for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of DoD SAP information,
information systems, and networks. This document applies to the DoD SAP Community and all
networks, information systems, and applications for which the cognizant SAPCO has management or
oversight responsibility regardless of the physical location. This includes Service elements, contractor
sites, and DoD organizations that connect to a SAP-managed network. This document supersedes all
previous dated versions of the JSIG.
As defined in CNSSI 4009, Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Glossary, an information
system is defined as, “a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.” This includes weapons systems,
test equipment, multifunction devices (e.g., copier/fax/scanner), et al. Information system components
are either purchased commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) or are custom-developed and can be deployed in
land-based, sea-based, airborne, space-based, and/or tactical IS.
All SAP IS are categorized as NSS as established in the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA), Title II, Public Law 107-347, December 17, 2002 (Section 3542, Paragraph (2)(A)(ii)), and
further described in NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National
Security System, August 2003.
1.3 RECIPROCITY
Reciprocity is defined as a “Mutual agreement among participating enterprises to accept each other’s
security assessments in order to reuse information system resources and/or to accept each other’s assessed
security posture in order to share information.” [CNSSI 4009]
This agreement, however, does not imply blind acceptance. The body of evidence used for assessments
of the subject system will be provided to the other participant(s) who have a vested interest in establishing
a mutual agreement. The receiving party will review the assessment evidence (e.g., system security plan
(SSP), test plans, test procedures, test reports, exceptions) and determine if there are any deltas in the
evidence, (e.g., baseline/overlay controls that were tailored, a test item that was omitted), and identify
items that may require negotiations.
Reciprocity means that the system(s) will not be retested or undergo another full assessment. In the spirit
of reciprocity, the existing assessments will be accepted; only controls, test items or other pertinent items
that were initially omitted are subject to evaluation/testing to assure the system meets any additional
protections required for a successful reciprocal agreement.

1.5 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved with the RMF are summarized in the paragraphs
below. Roles and responsibilities are detailed in NIST SP 800-37, Appendix D. Also reference DoDM
5205.07-V1.
1.5.1 Agency/Component Head
Each DoD SAP Component Head bears ultimate responsibility for mission accomplishment and
execution of business functions, and hence for adequately mitigating risks to the element, its individuals,
and the Nation. The Component Head establishes priorities to ensure collaboration and information-
sharing sufficient to ensure both element and DoD SAP Community-wide mission accomplishment. As
stated in DoDD 5205.07 Enclosure 5, DoD Component Heads appoint a DAA [AO] for all DoD IS and
PIT [Platform IT] systems under their purview and ensure all DoD IS and PIT systems are authorized.
DoD SAP systems shall be authorized in accordance with DoDM 5205.07-V1 and the JSIG. Each
component shall also establish in writing, the component’s SAP senior authorizing official. This
individual shall serve as the component lead at DoD level SAP cybersecurity strategy, policy, and, as
appropriate, investment forums. The SAP senior authorizing official is the only authorized waiver
authority for non-tailorable controls.
Reference DoDM 5205.07-V1, Enclosure 2, for responsibilities of the DoD Component Heads and OSD
Principal Staff Assistants (PSA) with cognizant authority (CA) and oversight authority (OA) over SAPs.
1.5.2 Risk Executive (Function)
The Risk Executive (function) (REF) is an individual or group within an organization that helps to ensure
that:
• Risk-related considerations for individual IS, to include authorization decisions, are viewed from
an organization-wide perspective with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of the
organization in carrying out its core missions and business functions; and
• Managing information system-related security risks is consistent across the organization, reflects
organizational risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risks in order to ensure
mission/business success.
The REF coordinates with the senior leadership and stakeholders of an organization to:
a. b. c. d. e. f. g. Provide a comprehensive, organization-wide, holistic approach for addressing risk—an approach
that provides a greater understanding of the integrated operations of the organization;
Develop a risk management strategy for the organization providing a strategic view of
information security-related risks with regard to the organization as a whole;
Facilitate the sharing of risk-related information among authorizing officials and other senior
leaders within the organization;
Provide oversight for all risk management-related activities across the organization (e.g., security
categorizations) to help ensure consistent and effective risk acceptance decisions;
Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and business
success;
Provide an organization-wide forum to consider all sources of risk (including aggregated risk) to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and national security;
Promote cooperation and collaboration among AOs and stakeholders to include authorization
actions requiring shared responsibility, e.g., for reciprocity;
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-14
h. Ensure that the shared responsibility for supporting organizational mission/business functions
using external providers of information and services receives the needed visibility and is elevated
to the appropriate decision-making authorities; and
i. Identify the organizational risk posture based on the aggregated risk to information from the
operation and use of the information systems for which the organization is responsible.
The REF serves as an adjunct advisor providing support to the AO/DAO. The REF has no authorization
authority. The REF must be comprised of U.S. citizens that are government employees.
1.5.3 Chief Information Officer (CIO)
The CIO is an organizational official responsible for:
• Designating a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO);
• Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and control techniques to
address all applicable requirements;
• Overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for information security and ensuring that
personnel are adequately trained;
• Assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security responsibilities; and
• In coordination with other senior officials, reporting annually to the head of the agency on the
overall effectiveness of the organization’s information security program, including progress of
remedial actions.
The CIO must be a U.S. citizen and a government employee. The CIO, with the support of the REF and
the CISO, works closely with the AO and their designated representatives to help ensure that:
a. b. c. d. e. An organization-wide information security program is effectively implemented resulting in
adequate security for all organizational IS and environments of operation for those systems;
Information security considerations are integrated into programming/planning/budgeting cycles,
enterprise architectures, and acquisition/system development life cycles;
Information systems are covered by approved security plans and are authorized to operate;
Information security-related activities required across the organization are accomplished in an
efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner; and
There is centralized reporting of appropriate information security-related activities.
1.5.4 Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
The CISO, also known as a Senior Information Security Officer (SISO), is responsible for carrying out
the CIO security responsibilities under FISMA. The CISO serves as the primary liaison for the CIO to
the organization’s AOs, Information System Owners (ISO), Common Control Providers (CCP), and
Information System Security Managers/Officers (ISSM/ISSO). The CISO must be a U.S. citizen and a
government employee.
The CISO shall:
• Possess professional qualifications, including training and experience, required to administer the
information security program functions;
• Maintain information security duties as a primary responsibility; and
• Head an office with the mission and resources to assist the organization in achieving more secure
information and IS, in accordance with the guidance provided by their respective CA for FISMA
compliance. All FISMA activities shall be maintained within channels and reported to the CA
SAPCO.
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-15
The CISO may also be appointed with the mission and resources to coordinate, develop, implement, and
maintain an organization-wide information security program. [PM-2]
1.5.5 Authorizing Official (AO)
The AO is a senior official or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating
an IS at an acceptable level of risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and national security. The AO must be
a U.S. citizen and a government employee. AOs typically have budgetary oversight for an IS or are
responsible for the mission and/or business operations supported by the system. Through the security
authorization process, AOs are accountable for the security risks associated with information system
operations. Accordingly, AOs are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with
understanding and accepting such information system-related security risks.
Responsibilities of the AO include, but are not limited to:
a. Ensure each IS is properly assessed and authorized based on its environment of operation,
security impact levels and security requirements;
b. Evaluate threats and vulnerabilities to information systems to ascertain the need for additional
safeguards;
c. d. e. f. g. Issue and maintain written security authorization statements;
Ensure records are maintained for all IS authorizations under his/her purview;
Ensure a security education, training, and awareness program is in place;
Ensure information system security is an element of the life-cycle process;
Ensure all DAOs and security control assessors (SCAs) are trained to properly perform their
duties;
h. i. Ensure all assessments are coordinated with the CA Program Security Officer (PSO);
Ensure organizations plan, budget, allocate, and spend adequate resources in support of IS
security;
j. Approve security plans, memorandums of agreement or understanding, and plans of action and
milestones and determine whether significant changes in the information systems or
environments of operation require reauthorization;
k. Deny authorization to operate an information system or if the system is operational, halt
operations, if unacceptable risks exist;
l. Coordinate their activities with the REF, CIO, CISO, CCP, ISO, ISSM/ISSO, SCA, and other
interested parties during the security authorization process; and,
m. Authority to specify, notwithstanding the requirements stated in this JSIG, a greater impact level
or amount of protection for any given system in any given environment.
With the increasing complexity of missions/business processes, partnership arrangements, and the use of
external/shared services, it is possible that a particular information system may involve multiple
authorizing officials. If so, agreements are established among the authorizing officials and documented in
the security plan.
An AO may appoint one or more Delegated Authorizing Official (DAO) to expedite authorizations of
designated systems, and provide mission support. Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that
all activities and functions associated with security authorization that are delegated to authorizing official
designated representatives are carried out.
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-16
1.5.6 Delegated Authorizing Official (DAO)
The DAO is an organizational official appointed in writing and authorized to act on behalf of an AO in
carrying out and coordinating the required activities associated with security authorization including,
when explicitly delegated, the authority to authorize a system to operate. A DAO has inherent U.S.
Government authority and, as such, must be a government employee. Like an AO, a DAO shall have a
broad and strategic understanding of the DoD SAP Community. A DAO shall use this knowledge to
assign appropriate weight to the often competing equities of mission and security requirements, budget
consequences, operational performance efficiencies, schedule requirements, counterintelligence concerns,
civil liberty and privacy protection, and other relevant policy requirements. Then, in light of these factors,
the DAO shall determine the level of risk deemed acceptable when authorizing systems. DAOs can be
empowered by AOs to make certain decisions with regard to the planning and resourcing of the security
authorization process, approval of the SSP, approval and monitoring the implementation of a Plan of
Action and Milestones (POA&M), and the assessment and/or determination of risk. The delegation letter
must outline specific authorities including impact levels, i.e., low, moderate, or high for confidentiality,
integrity, and availability.
1.5.7 Security Control Assessor (SCA)
A SCA is an individual appointed in writing by the AO to act on his or her behalf to conduct a security
assessment. The SCA is responsible for conducting a comprehensive assessment of the management,
operational, and technical security controls employed within or inherited by an IS to determine the overall
effectiveness of the controls (i.e., the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
system). SCAs also provide an assessment of the severity of weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in the
IS and its environment of operation and recommend corrective actions to address identified
vulnerabilities.
Prior to initiating the security control assessment, the SCA reviews the SSP to ensure the plan provides a
set of security controls for the IS that meet the stated security requirements. Within the DoD SAP
Community an ISSM or other AO designee may be delegated in writing to perform security control
assessments for specific information systems on the SCA’s behalf. These designees must send their
assessment results to the SCA for further action.
Responsibilities of the SCA, under the direction of the AO, include, but are not limited to:
a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. Advise the ISO and PSO concerning the impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and
availability for the information on a system;
Evaluate threats and vulnerabilities to information systems to ascertain the need for additional
safeguards;
Review and approve the information system Security Assessment Plan, which is comprised of the
SSP, the SCTM, and the Security Control Assessment Procedures;
Ensure security assessments are completed for each IS;
At the conclusion of each security assessment activity, prepare and submit the final Security
Assessment Report (SAR) containing the results and findings from the assessment and a
recommended authorization decision to the AO;
Ensure system POA&M reflects identified weaknesses and suspense dates for each IS based on
findings and recommendations from the SAR;
Evaluate security assessment documentation and provide written recommendations for security
authorization to the AO;
Submit the security authorization package to the AO; and
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-17
i. Assess proposed changes to information systems, their environment of operation, and mission
needs that could affect system authorization.
1.5.8 Common Control Provider (CCP)
A CCP is an individual, group, or organization responsible for the development, implementation,
assessment, and monitoring of common security controls (i.e., security controls inherited by information
systems).
Responsibilities of the CCP include, but are not limited to:
a. b. c. d. Document the organization-identified common controls in a SSP;
Ensure that required assessments of common controls are carried out by qualified assessors;
Document assessment findings in a SAR; and
Produce and maintain a POA&M for all common security controls having weaknesses or
deficiencies; and,
e. Ensure SSPs, SARs, and POA&Ms for common controls are made available to ISOs inheriting
those controls.
1.5.9 Program Security Officer (PSO)
Reference DoDM 5205.07, SAP Security Manual, all volumes.
1.5.10 Information Owner/Steward
An information owner is an organizational official with statutory, management, or operational authority
for specific information who has the responsibility for establishing the policies and procedures governing
its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. The information owner/steward must
be a U.S. citizen and a government employee. Each respective CA SAPCO shall also serve as the
information owner/steward. In information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is
responsible for establishing the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g.,
rules of behavior) and retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with or provided to
other organizations. The owner/steward of the information processed, stored, or transmitted by an
information system may or may not be the same as the ISO. A single information system may contain
information from multiple information owners/stewards. Information owners/stewards provide input to
ISOs regarding:
• Sensitivity of information under the information owner/steward’s purview;
• Confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact levels associated with the information
owner/steward’s data;
• Unique requirements for managing the information owner/steward’s data (e.g., incident response,
information contamination to other systems/media, unique audit requirements); and,
• Whether foreign nationals may access the information owner/steward’s data.
1.5.11 Mission/Business Owner (MBO)
The MBO has operational responsibility for the mission or business process supported by the
mission/business segment or the information system and is the key stakeholder for system lifecycle
decisions (e.g., agency/component head, chief executive officer, chief financial officer). The MBO
ensures that information security requirements are integrated into the system development life cycle
process. The MBO must be a U.S. citizen and a government employee.
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-18
1.5.12 Information System Owner (ISO)
An ISO is an organizational official, (i.e., government PM or contractor PM (for contractor owned
systems)) responsible for the procurement, development, integration, modification, operation,
maintenance, and disposal of an information system. The ISO is responsible for addressing the
operational interests of the user community (i.e., users who require access to the information system to
satisfy mission, business, or operational requirements) and for ensuring compliance with information
security requirements.
Responsibilities of the ISO include, but are not limited to:
a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. j. k. Plan and budget for adequate on-site information security resources assigned to information
systems under their purview;
Ensure compliance with current cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA) policies, concepts, and
measures when designing, procuring, adopting, and developing new IS;
Ensure development and maintenance of the documentation required for authorization to operate
(e.g., SSP, SAR, POA&M) and that the system is deployed and operated in accordance with the
agreed-upon security controls;
Determine, in coordination with the information owner/steward, the individuals eligible for
access to the system and the types of privileges or access rights required;
If required to meet DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, and as directed
by the CA SAPCO, resource and appoint an ISSE in writing to ensure:
• The system is designed, developed, and implemented with required security features and
safeguards;
• Enhancements to existing systems provide equal or improved security features and
safeguards;
Coordinate with the AO to ensure the appropriate SCA (or other AO designee) is identified as
early as possible for ongoing coordination on security decisions. SCA participation is most
important at the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and the Critical Design Review (CDR). This
will ensure systems are fielded or modified within acceptable risk parameters and the latest
security technology is being incorporated into system designs;
Ensure the Configuration Management (CM) process is addressed and used when new IS are
under development, being procured, or delivered for operation. CM is an integral part of the
system authorization process. Therefore, it is imperative that the AO/DAO be advised of CM
decisions;
Ensure all information systems acquisitions (to include weapon systems) remain compliant with
IA and technology acquisition requirements as depicted in DoD Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, The
Defense Acquisition System, and DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System;
Ensure a risk assessment is performed on the IS while under development and keep the risk
assessment current throughout the acquisition/development portion of the life cycle;
Ensure security controls are implemented that protect the IS during development;
Ensure all steps involved in the acquisition and delivery of an IS are followed. These include, but
are not limited to:
• Clearly describe the IS mission;
• Formulate a concept and design for meeting the security requirements;
• Incorporate security requirements during system development;
• Evaluate interoperability with other systems;
Chapter 1-Introduction and Roles PAGE 1-19
l. m. n. Produce/develop security documentation (SSP, POA&M, Security Assessment Plan, etc.) as input
to the Security Authorization Package and submit package to the AO via the SCA;
Coordinate a Security Assessment schedule with the SCA; and
Ensure the POA&M is updated to describe the planned tasks for correcting identified weaknesses
within the established timeframes and address any residual findings.
1.5.13 Information System Security Engineer (ISSE)
An ISSE is an individual or group responsible for conducting information system security engineering
activities. Information system security engineering is a process that captures and refines information
security requirements and ensures that the requirements are effectively integrated into information
systems through purposeful security architecting, design, development, and configuration. The ISSE is an
integral part of the development team designing and developing organizational information systems or
upgrading legacy systems. The ISSE employs best practices when implementing security requirements
within an information system including software engineering methodologies, system/security engineering
principles, secure design, secure architecture, and secure coding techniques.
The ISSE shall be appointed in writing and shall ensure the information system is designed, developed,
and implemented with required security features and safeguards. If the ISSM/ISSO is identified to fulfill
the role of ISSE, their appointment letter will reflect this and they will fulfill the tasks outlined for the
ISSE in addition to the tasks assigned to an ISSM/ISSO.
Reference 2.3.1, RMF Step 1, for when an ISSE is required and who can fulfill those roles. Some
organizations also refer to an ISSE as an Information Security Architect or Information Assurance
Systems Architect and Engineer (IASAE).
1.5.14 Information System Security Manager (ISSM)
An ISSM is an individual who serves as a principal advisor on all matters, technical and otherwise,
involving the security of information systems under his/her purview. The ISSM shall be appointed in
writing by their respective chain of command/leadership (e.g., Commander, Commanding Officer, PM,
CIO, PSO, or corporate equivalent). When circumstances warrant, a single individual may fill both the
ISSM and the ISSO roles. ISSM responsibilities should not be assigned as collateral duties. The ISSM
must retain a copy of his/her appointment letter.
Responsibilities of an ISSM include, but are not limited to:
a. Develop and maintain a formal IS security program and policies for their assigned area of
responsibility;
b. Develop and oversee operational information systems security implementation policy and
guidelines;
c. Coordinate with PSO or cognizant security official on approval of external information systems
(e.g., guest systems, interconnected system with another organization);
d. Ensure ISSOs under their purview are appointed in writing and provide oversight to ensure ISSOs
follow established IS policies and procedures;
e. g. The ISSM shall assume ISSO responsibilities in the absence of the ISSO;
f. Maintain required IA certifications;
Ensure System Administrators (SA) monitor all available resources that provide warnings of
system vulnerabilities or ongoing attacks;
h. Ensure periodic testing is conducted to evaluate the security posture of IS by employing various
intrusion/attack detection and monitoring tools (shared responsibility with ISSOs);

2 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (RMF)
2.1 Introduction to the RMF
NIST, in partnership with DoD, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and CNSS,
developed a common information security framework for the federal government and its contractors to
improve information security, strengthen risk management processes, and encourage reciprocity among
federal agencies. NIST SP 800-37, developed by the Joint Task Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative
Working Group, transforms the traditional C&A process into the six-step RMF. The revised process
emphasizes:
• Building information security capabilities into federal information systems through the
application of community best practices for management, operational, and technical security
controls;
• Maintaining awareness of the security state of information systems on an ongoing basis through
enhanced monitoring processes; and
• Providing essential information to senior leaders to facilitate decisions regarding the acceptance
of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and national
security arising from the operation and use of information systems.
The six-step RMF is depicted in Figure 2-1. The RMF steps include:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Categorize the IS and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system based on
an analysis of the impact due to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the IS based on the security categorization;
apply overlay(s), if applicable; then tailor the security control baseline as needed based on an
organizational assessment of risk and local conditions.
Implement the security controls and describe how the controls are employed within the IS and its
environment of operation.
Assess the security controls using appropriate assessment procedures to determine the extent to
which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.
Authorize IS operation based on a determination of the risk to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and national security resulting from the operation of the
IS and the decision that this risk is acceptable.
Monitor the security controls in the IS on an ongoing basis to include assessing control
effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or its environment of operation, conducting
security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system
to designated organizational officials.
Figure 2-1: Risk Management Framework (RMF)
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-24
Each RMF step includes associated tasks to be carried out by the appropriate organization or individual.
These steps and the tasks associated with them, as they apply to the DoD SAP Community and to all IS
under the purview of the cognizant SAP AO, are described briefly in Section 2.3. For additional details
regarding RMF, see NIST SP 800-37.
2.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RMF
2.2.1 Organization-Wide Risk Management
Managing information system-related security risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires
the involvement of the entire organization—from senior leaders providing the strategic vision and top-
level goals and objectives for the organization, to mid-level leaders planning and managing projects, to
individuals on the front lines developing, implementing, and operating the systems supporting the
organization’s core missions and business processes. Risk management can be viewed as a holistic
activity that is fully integrated into every aspect of the organization. Figure 2-2 illustrates a three-tiered
approach to risk management that addresses risk-related concerns at the organization level, the mission
and business process level and the information system level. Risk assessments, as described in NIST SP
800-30, provide critical details that guide and inform the security control selection process.
Figure 2-2: Tiered Risk Management Approach
Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective with the development of a comprehensive
governance structure and organization-wide risk management strategy. For the DoD SAP Community,
this includes governance provided by the DoD, DoD SAPCO and respective Service/Agency SAPCOs
and includes the:
• Techniques and methodologies the organization plans to employ to assess information system-
related security risks and other types of risk of concern to the organization;
• Methods and procedures the organization plans to use to evaluate the significance of the risks
identified during the risk assessment;
• Types and extent of risk mitigation measures the organization plans to employ to address
identified risks;
• Level of risk the organization is willing to accept (i.e., risk tolerance);
• Organization’s plans to monitor risk on an ongoing basis given the inevitable changes to
organizational information systems and their environments of operation; and
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-25
• Degree and type of oversight the organization plans to use to ensure that the risk management
strategy is being effectively carried out.
Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective and is guided by the risk decisions
at Tier 1. Tier 2 activities are closely associated with enterprise architecture, to include Wide Area
Network (WAN) services (i.e., backbone communications), enterprise services (such as audit reduction
tools, network monitoring tools, identity management systems), and services provided across a
site/campus (e.g., physical and personnel security). Because subordinate organizations responsible for
carrying out derivative or related missions and business processes may have already invested in their own
methods of assessing, evaluating, mitigating, accepting and monitoring risk, parent organizations may
allow a greater degree of autonomy within parts of the organization or across the entire organization in
order to minimize costs. When a diversity of risk assessment methods is allowed, organizations may
choose to employ, when feasible, some means of integration of the risk-related information to ensure that
the output of the different risk assessment activities can be correlated in a meaningful manner.
Tier 3 addresses risk from an information system perspective and is guided by the risk decisions at Tiers 1
and 2. Risk decisions at Tiers 1 and 2 impact the ultimate selection and deployment of needed safeguards
and countermeasures (i.e., security controls) at the information system level. Information security
requirements are satisfied by the selection and successful implementation of appropriate management,
operational, and technical security controls from NIST SP 800-53. For all DoD SAP information systems
under the purview of the cognizant SAP AO, security control selection is guided by the RMF process as
directed by DoDM 5205.07, DoD SAP Security Manual, and described in the JSIG (i.e., this document) in
Section 2.3 below.
2.2.2 System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
All federal information systems, including operational systems, systems under development, and systems
undergoing modification or upgrade, are in some phase of a SDLC. NIST identifies five phases of a
general SDLC as Initiation, Acquisition/Development, Implementation/Assessment,
Operations/Maintenance, and Disposition/Sunset. Risk management tasks begin early in the SDLC and
are important in shaping the security capabilities of the information system. If these tasks are not
adequately performed during the initiation, development, and acquisition phases of the SDLC, the tasks
will, by necessity, be undertaken later in the life cycle and be more costly to implement. In either
situation, all tasks must be completed prior to placing the information system into operation, or
continuing its operation, to ensure that information system-related security risks are adequately addressed
on an ongoing basis and that the AO explicitly understands and accepts the risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and national security based on the implementation
of the defined set of security controls and the current security state of the information system.
Requirements definition is a critical part of any system development process and begins very early in the
life cycle, typically in the initiation phase. Security requirements are a subset of the overall functional
and nonfunctional (e.g., quality, assurance) requirements levied on an information system and are
incorporated into the SDLC simultaneously with the functional and nonfunctional requirements. Without
the early integration of security requirements, significant expense may be incurred by the organization
later in the life cycle to address security considerations that could have been included in the initial design.
When security requirements are considered as an integral subset of other information system
requirements, the resulting system has fewer weaknesses and deficiencies, and therefore fewer
vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the future.
Early integration of information security requirements into the SDLC is the most cost-effective and
efficient method for an organization to ensure that its protection strategy is implemented. It also ensures
that information security processes are not isolated from the other routine management processes
employed by the organization to develop, implement, operate, and maintain information systems
supporting ongoing missions and business functions. In addition to incorporating information security
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-26
requirements into the SDLC, security requirements are also integrated into the program, planning, and
budgeting activities within the organization to ensure that resources are available when needed and
program/project milestones are completed in accordance with the agreed-upon schedule.
Organizations should maximize the use of security-relevant information (e.g., assessment results,
information system documentation, and other artifacts) generated during the SDLC to satisfy
requirements for similar information needed for information security-related purposes. The reuse of
security-relevant information by organizations is an effective method to help eliminate duplication of
effort, reduce documentation, promote reciprocity, and avoid unnecessary costs that may result when
security activities are conducted independently of system development life cycle processes. In addition,
reuse promotes greater consistency of information used in the design, development, implementation,
operation, maintenance, and disposition of an information system including security-related
considerations.
Throughout the SDLC system owners must be cognizant of changes to the system, documenting and
following a change control process to ensure configuration management. Since systems routinely
experience changes over time to accommodate new requirements, new technologies or new risks, they
must be routinely analyzed in respect to the security posture. All changes shall be captured, approved by
the AO as required, and documented in the SSP. Major or significant changes may require re-
authorization of the system.
The figure below, from DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information
Technology (IT), depicts the alignment of RMF steps with the DoD Acquisition Management System,
which is explained in DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System.

Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-27
2.2.3 Information System Boundaries
One of the most challenging problems for the ISO, AO, CIO, CISO, ISSM/ISSO, and ISSE is identifying
appropriate boundaries for information systems. With regard to the risk management process and
information security, the term information system boundary is synonymous with authorization boundary.
Well-defined boundaries establish the scope of protection for information systems (i.e., what the
organization agrees to protect under its direct management control or within the scope of its
responsibilities) and include the people, processes, and information technologies that are part of the
systems supporting the organization’s missions and business processes. Information system boundaries
are established in coordination with the security categorization process and before the development of the
SSP. Information system boundaries that are too expansive (i.e., too many system components and/or
unnecessary architectural complexity) make the risk management process extremely unwieldy and
complex. Boundaries that are too limited increase the number of information systems that must be
separately managed and as a consequence, unnecessarily inflate the total information security costs for the
organization.
2.2.3.1 Establishing Information System Boundaries
Organizations have significant flexibility in determining what constitutes an information system and its
associated boundary. In addition to consideration of direct management control, organizations may also
consider whether the information resources being identified as an information system:
• Support the same mission/business objectives or functions and essentially the same operating
characteristics and information security requirements;
• Reside in the same general operating environment (or in the case of a distributed information
system, reside in various locations with similar operating environments); or
• Reside in the same geographic area (e.g., a site or campus environment).
Since commonality can change over time, the determination of the information system boundary should
be revisited periodically as part of the organization’s continuous monitoring process. While the above
considerations may be useful to organizations in determining information system boundaries for purposes
of risk management, they are not viewed as limiting the organization’s flexibility in establishing
commonsense boundaries that promote effective information security within the available resources of the
organization. Information system owners shall consult with key participants, (e.g., AO, CIO, CISO,
ISSE, the REF, and other individuals with a vested interest) when establishing or changing system
boundaries. The process of establishing information system boundaries and the associated risk
management implications is an organization-wide activity that takes into account mission and business
requirements, technical considerations with respect to information security, and programmatic costs to the
organization.
Once an information system boundary is set, any interconnections with systems outside of that
authorization boundary that are approved by a different AO are governed by Interconnection Security
Agreements (ISA).
2.2.3.2 Boundaries for Complex Information Systems
The application of security controls within a complex information system can present significant
challenges to an organization. From a centralized development, implementation, and operations
perspective, the ISO, in collaboration with the AO, CISO, and ISSE, examines the purpose of the
information system and considers the feasibility of segmenting the complex system into more manageable
subsystems. From a distributed development, implementation, and operations perspective, the
organization recognizes that multiple entities, possibly operating under different policies, may be
contributing to the development, implementation, and/or operations of the subsystems that compose the
complex information system. In such cases, the organization is responsible for ensuring that these
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-28
separate subsystems can work together in both a secure and functional manner. Treating an information
system as multiple subsystems, each with its own subsystem boundary, facilitates a more targeted
application of security controls to achieve adequate security and a more cost-effective risk management
process. Knowledge of the security properties of individual subsystems does not necessarily provide the
complete knowledge of the security properties of the complex information system. The organization
applies best practices in systems and security engineering and documents the segmentation of the
information system in the SSP.
Information security architecture plays a key part in the security control selection and allocation process
for a complex information system. This includes monitoring and controlling communications at key
internal boundaries among subsystems and providing system-wide common controls that meet or exceed
the requirements of the constituent subsystems inheriting those system-wide common controls. While
subsystems within complex information systems may exist as complete systems, the subsystems are, in
most cases, not treated as independent entities because they are typically interdependent and
interconnected.
Security controls for the interconnection of subsystems are employed when the subsystems implement
different security policies or are administered by different authorities. The extent to which the security
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
respect to meeting the security requirements for the complex information system, can be determined by
combining security control assessments at the subsystem level and adding system-level considerations
addressing interface issues among subsystems. This approach facilitates a more targeted and cost-
effective risk management process by scaling the level of effort of the assessment in accordance with the
subsystem security categorization and allowing for reuse of assessment results at the information system
level.
2.2.3.3 External Information Systems
External information systems, formerly known as guest systems, are information systems or components
of information systems that are outside the authorization boundary of the organization and for which the
organization has no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security controls or
the assessment of security control effectiveness. An external information system may be a standalone or
an interconnected system/service.
If the system is authorized by an organization other than the Special Access Program Facility’s (SAPF)
cognizant security authority (CSA) organization, it is an external information system. The PSO,
government SAP security officer (GSSO) and/or contractor PSO (CPSO), as appropriate for the SAPF,
with ISSM/ISSO coordination, provide written approval of the entry of the external information system
into the SAPF. (Reference AC-20)
2.2.3.4 Information Assurance Standard Operating Procedures (IA SOP)
The IA SOP, formerly referred to as a Master SSP (MSSP), provides guidance for the management, use,
protection, dissemination, and transmission of program data as it relates to an information system within a
SAPF. It is frequently used where the IA-related processes (e.g., configuration management, incident
response, media handling, hardware acquisition, movement, and release) are standardized for multiple
systems throughout the facility, site or campus. The IA SOP augments the Facility SOP by providing
comprehensive procedures and baseline standards for all IA-related processes and procedures. Where a
process may deviate from the norm (as described in the IA SOP) for a particular system, the system
specific process is captured in that system’s SSP.
AO approval of an IA SOP implies general approval of the processes and procedures captured; it does not
imply approval of an information system. An SSP specific to a system is required, denoting in the
document where a process or procedure is addressed in the IA SOP. The IA SOP must accompany the
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-29
SSP as part of the security authorization package requesting an ATO from the AO. Ensure an ATO is
granted for each system prior to processing on the system.
2.3 RMF SIX-STEP PROCESS
The RMF and associated RMF tasks apply to both ISOs and common control providers. In addition to
supporting the authorization of an IS to operate, the RMF tasks support the categorization of the IS, and
the selection, implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of security controls for each IS.
Many of the security controls applicable to a system are common controls that are inheritable by the
system.
The RMF is life cycle-based; therefore, organizations will need to revisit various tasks over time
depending on how the organization manages changes to its information systems and the environment in
which those systems operate. Managing information security-related risks for an information system is
viewed as part of a larger organization-wide risk management activity carried out by senior leaders. The
RMF must simultaneously provide a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks from the
operation and use of information systems and the flexibility and agility to support the core missions and
business operations of the organization in a highly dynamic environment of operation.
The six RMF steps and the tasks associated with them, as they apply to DoD SAP systems and all other
systems under the purview of the cognizant SAP AO, are described in the sections that follow.
2.3.1 RMF Step 1, Categorize
Step 1 of the RMF focuses on categorizing the IS. Information systems shall be categorized based on the
impact due to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information or information
system.
With approval of the cognizant SAP AO, the ISO of a legacy IS in coordination with the SCA will
determine the categorization of the IS prior to its transition to RMF. For all information systems - legacy,
initial development, or major revision, the ISO shall assign an ISSE at program inception, where required
by the AO. The ISSE level of expertise required is dependent on the size and complexity of the IS. The
ISSE could be a dedicated role on a large, complex system or the ISSE could oversee several smaller, less
complex systems. The function of ISSE could also be performed by the ISSM/ISSO on smaller, less
complex systems. This decision is made by the cognizant SAP AO after discussions with the ISO and
ISSM/ISSO.
The ISO, in conjunction with the ISSM/ISSO and ISSE, is responsible for the following tasks when
categorizing the information system:
• Task 1-1: Categorize the information system and document the results in the SSP.
Each IS shall be categorized by defining the impact levels that would result from a loss of confidentiality,
integrity, and availability as indicated in CNSSI 1253, section 3.1:
Security categorization is a two-step process:
Step 1. Determine impact values for (i) information type(s) processed, stored, transmitted, or
protected by the system; and (ii) for the information system.
Step 2. Identify overlays that apply to the IS and its operating environment to account for
additional factors.
Potential impact determination for information types required for Step 1 above is further explained in
Section 3.1.1 of CNSSI 1253. Additional factors that may raise the impact level of system categorization
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-30
higher than any impact level assigned to the information types include aggregation of data and critical
system functionality. Reference NIST SP 800-60 Vol I, Section 4.4.2 for additional guidance.
Identifying an applicable overlay during RMF Step 1-Categorize, ensures the system categorization is
based on an accurate authorization boundary and that appropriate terms are used in the description, e.g.,
standalone, Cross Domain Solution (CDS). The Classified Overlay applies to all classified NSS
including DoD SAP IS and is considered part of the JSIG baseline control set.
The security categorization process is initiated by the ISO who, in coordination with the information
owner/steward, proposes the initial impact levels. Security impact levels are defined as low, moderate or
high for each of the three security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability). For
example, an information system may have a confidentiality impact level of moderate, an integrity impact
level of moderate, and an availability impact level of low.
The impact values shall be documented in the SSP along with the research, key decisions, approvals, and
supporting rationale. The SCA will review the proposed security impact levels and provide
recommendations to the AO. Security impact levels are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and
threat information in assessing the risk to an organization.
The following paragraphs provide guidance in defining impact levels for all information systems under
the purview of the cognizant SAP AO with additional amplification of the terms limited, serious, and
severe relative to impact levels provided in Section 2.3.1.4.
2.3.1.1 Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level for all SAP systems shall be moderate or high. The confidentiality
impact level is:
• Moderate if the unauthorized disclosure of any information processed, stored and transmitted by
the IS could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations,
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the national security interests of the
United States.
• High if the unauthorized disclosure of any information processed, stored and transmitted by the
IS could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational
operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the national security
interests of the United States.
In addition to the above guidance, the adjustments shown in Table 2-1 shall be applied when defining the
confidentiality impact level for Special Access Required (SAR) data. Reference the Confidentiality
Impact Level Flowchart in Appendix D for Secret (S) and Top Secret (TS) SAR to determine the
confidentiality impact level and applicable overlays as discussed in Section 2.3.1.5 Overlays.

Table 2-1: Confidentiality Impact Level Adjustments
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-31
2.3.1.2 Integrity
The integrity impact level is:
• Low if the unauthorized modification or destruction of any information processed, stored
and transmitted by the IS could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on
organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
national security interests of the United States.
• Moderate if the unauthorized modification or destruction of any information processed,
stored and transmitted by the IS could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on
organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
national security interests of the United States.
• High if the unauthorized modification or destruction of any information processed, stored
and transmitted by the IS could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the national security interests of the United States.
2.3.1.3 Availability
The availability impact level is:
• Low if the disruption of access to or use of any information processed, stored and transmitted by
the IS could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations,
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the national security interests of the
United States, (e.g., limited impact if system is down more than 24 hours).
• Moderate if the disruption of access to or use of any information processed, stored and
transmitted by the IS could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational
operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the national security
interests of the United States, (e.g., serious impact unless system is up in less than 24 hours).
• High if the disruption of access to or use of any information processed, stored and transmitted by
the IS could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational
operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the national security
interests of the United States, (e.g., severe impact unless system is up within x_minutes).
2.3.1.4 Amplification
The following provides amplification of terms used in determining impact levels.
• A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the
organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is
noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor
financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.
• A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and
duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the
functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii)
result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not
involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.
• A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality,
integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-32
extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary
functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss;
or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life
threatening injuries.
2.3.1.5 Overlays
Table 2-2 below provides additional guidance for adjusting the overall security categorization levels
through the use of overlays. An overlay is a predefined control set which modifies or enhances the
baseline controls and targets specific data sets (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII) or privacy
data), system type (e.g., CDS, platform IT (PIT)), and/or environment (e.g., space, tactical).

• Task 1-3: Register the information system with the appropriate SAP Service/Agency AO or
designee. The registration establishes the relationship between the information system and the
governing organization of that system and results in the formal assignment of a SCA for the
information system.
• Output from Step 1
o Draft SSP
o System registration
Ideally, a risk assessment is conducted before or during this step and documented in a Risk Assessment
Report (RAR) to begin identifying risks to the system.
2.3.2 RMF Step 2, Select
Step 2 of the RMF focuses on selecting the security controls applicable to the information system. The
ISO, along with assistance from the ISSE and/or ISSM/ISSO, is responsible for the following tasks:
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-33
• Task 2-1: Identify the security controls that are provided by the organization as common
controls for all or multiple information systems under the organization’s control and document
the controls in a security plan. Control implementation can be characterized as system specific
(S), common (C) or hybrid (H). (The abbreviations are generally used in charts only.) System
specific security controls are security controls specific to an IS and are the responsibility of the
ISO. Common controls are security controls that are inheritable by one or more organizational
information systems and are typically provided by the organization or the infrastructure. Hybrid
security controls are security controls that are implemented in an IS in part as a common control
and in part as a system specific control and must be taken into consideration by the ISO. Security
controls shall be documented in the SCTM, which is a component of the SSP. ISOs should
reference the governing source that documents the implementation of the common (i.e., inherited)
controls.
• Task 2-2: Select the security controls for the information system and document the controls in
the security plan. SAP systems utilize the CNSSI 1253 methodology for Security Control
Selection (Section 3.2, RMF Step 2, Task 2-2) into two steps: select the initial security control set
and tailor the initial security control set.
1. Select the initial security control set
• Select the baseline security controls identified from JSIG Appendix C, which
includes the Classified Overlay security controls and SAP defined organization
values, corresponding to the security category of the system (i.e., the impact values
determined for each security objective [confidentiality, integrity, and availability]).
• Apply any overlay(s) identified as applicable during security categorization. If the
use of multiple overlays results in conflicts between the application or removal of
security controls, the AO (or designee), in coordination with the information
owner/steward, information system owner, and risk executive (function) resolves the
conflict.
• Document the initial security control set and the rationale for adding or removing
security controls from the baseline by referencing the applicable overlay(s) in the
SCTM as part of the security plan.
2. Tailor the initial security control set
• Tailor the initial security control set, including the organization-defined values, as
appropriate.
• Document in the SSP the relevant decisions made during the tailoring process,
providing a sound rationale for those decisions.
Tailoring the controls as needed means to tailor in controls to supplement the set of selected
controls, as well as tailor out or modify the controls, as applicable based on the system risk
assessment. If a security control identified in the baseline set of controls is tailored out, an
explanation must be provided in the SCTM portion of the SSP, describing the rationale as to why
the control does not apply or how it is satisfied by other mitigating factors. An explanation must
also be provided in the SCTM if an organization-defined value is modified. Security controls
may also be added (i.e., tailored in) as necessary depending upon the information system and/or
its environment of operation. Ensure the SCA reviews the final set of controls prior to Step 3,
Implement.
• Task 2-3: Develop a strategy for continuous monitoring of the security control effectiveness.
The implementation of a robust continuous monitoring program allows an organization to
understand the security state of the information system over time and maintain the initial security
authorization in a highly dynamic environment of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities,
technologies, and missions/business functions. Ongoing monitoring of the security controls is a
critical part of risk management that must be developed early in the SDLC. Effective monitoring
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-34
includes, but is not limited to, configuration management and control, security impact analyses on
proposed changes, assessment of selected security controls, and security status reporting.
• Task 2-4: Review and approve the SSP. The AO, SCA, or other AO designee, review the SSP
to determine if the plan is updated, consistent, meets the established security requirements and
identifies potential risks. This task ensures the AO concurs with the ISO on system
categorization and control set (baseline, overlay(s), tailoring) relative to the assessed risk.
Feedback shall be provided to the ISO, ISSM/ISSO, and ISSE. Any exceptions to the baseline
controls and overlay controls must be approved by the AO.
• Output from Step 2
o Updated draft SSP/SCTM
o Draft Risk Assessment Report (RAR)
o Documented Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) Plan/Strategy
o Approved draft SSP/SCTM
2.3.3 RMF Step 3, Implement (Develop/Build)
Step 3 of the RMF focuses on implementing the security controls selected for the IS (i.e., developing or
building the information system). The ISO, with assistance from the ISSE, is responsible for the
following tasks:
• Task 3-1: Implement the security controls specified in the SSP.
• Task 3-2: Document the security control implementation in the SCTM portion of the SSP
providing a functional description of the control implementation (including planned inputs,
expected behavior, and expected outputs). The documentation shall include any additional
information necessary to describe how the security capability required by the security control is
achieved at the level of detail sufficient to support control assessment. The level of effort
expended on documentation of the information system is commensurate with the purpose, scope,
and impact of the system with respect to organizational missions, business functions, and
operations.
• Output from Step 3
o Updated SSP/SCTM
2.3.4 RMF Step 4, Assess (Test)
Step 4 of the RMF focuses on assessing the security controls applicable to the information system and
includes the following tasks:
• Task 4-1: Develop, review, and approve a plan to assess the security controls.
The ISO, in conjunction with the ISSM/ISSO or ISSE, shall develop a plan to assess the security
controls. The Security Assessment Plan shall provide the objectives for the security control
assessment, the proposed method for verifying compliance with security controls, a proposed
schedule for conducting the assessment, and assessment procedures. The assessment plan will be
reviewed by the SCA to ensure the plan is consistent with the security objectives of the
organization; employs state-of-the-practice tools, techniques, procedures, and automation to
support the concept of continuous monitoring and near real-time risk management; and is cost-
effective with regard to the resources allocated for the assessment. The SCA will approve the
Security Assessment Plan, which will establish appropriate expectations for the security control
assessment, define the level of effort for the assessment and ensure the appropriate level of
resources are applied in determining the effectiveness of the security controls.
• Task 4-2: Assess the security controls in accordance with the security procedures defined in the
Security Assessment Plan.
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-35
The security assessment, frequently conducted by the SCA, or other AO designee, determines the
extent to which the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements. Additional
testing may be conducted at the discretion of the SCA or designee. Some security assessments
may require an approval from an AO, depending on data, connections, locations, etc., and the
type of testing planned, e.g., interconnections, CDS, penetration testing, etc. An interim
authorization to test (IATT) may be requested if, for example, the assessment will include
connecting to an operational system, network, or Research Development Test and Evaluation
(RDT&E) environment that is already under an authorization to operate (ATO). Additionally, an
ISA or authorization to connect (ATC) may be required when connecting a system under
assessment to an operational infrastructure (e.g., RDT&E network to operational LAN).
• Task 4-3: Prepare the Security Assessment Report (SAR) documenting issues, findings and
recommendations from the security control assessment as they pertain to the IS. The SAR is
written by the individual(s) performing the assessment, frequently the SCA. However,
ISSM/ISSOs may use the SAR to document self-assessment results and, at the direction of the
AO/SCA, include a SAR in the Security Authorization Package.
• Task 4-4: Conduct initial remediation actions based on the findings and recommendations of the
SAR and reassess remediated controls, as appropriate.
The AO/SCA may determine that certain findings are significant and require immediate
remediation actions. If weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls are corrected, the
remediated controls must be reassessed by the SCA or designee to determine the extent to which
the remediated controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the IS. The SAR is
updated with the findings from the reassessment, maintaining a copy of the original assessment
results. The ISO shall ensure the SSP is updated as appropriate based on the findings of the
security control assessment and any remediation actions taken. The updated SSP shall reflect the
actual state of the security controls after the initial assessment and any modifications by the ISO,
ISSM/ISSO, ISSE, or common control provider in addressing recommendations for corrective
actions. At the completion of the assessment step, the SSP will contain an accurate list and
description of the security controls implemented, including compensating controls, and a list of
residual vulnerabilities. A compensating control is defined in CNSSI 4009 as, “a management,
operational, and technical control (i.e., safeguard or countermeasure) employed by an
organization in lieu of a recommended security control in the low, moderate, or high
baselines…that provides equivalent or comparable protection for an information system.”
Security control assessments may be carried out during system development, system implementation, and
system operation/maintenance (as part of continuous monitoring).
• Output from Step 4
o Security Assessment Plan
o SAR
o Updated RAR
o Updated SSP
2.3.5 RMF Step 5, Authorize (Deploy/Operate)
Step 5 of the RMF focuses on authorizing the information system for operation and includes the
following tasks:
• Task 5-1: The Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) is initiated based on findings and
recommendations from the SAR.
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-36
The ISO is responsible for updating the POA&M, to include identifying corrective actions, determining
resources required, documenting milestone completion dates, and addressing any residual findings. The
POA&M shall identify:
• Tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion either before or after
information system implementation. This is usually an input provided by the SCA who
performed the assessment.
• Resources required to accomplish the tasks.
• Any milestones in meeting the tasks, to include percentage completed.
• Scheduled completion dates for the milestones.
The POA&M is used by the AO to monitor the progress in mitigating any findings.
• Task 5-2: Assemble and submit the security authorization package to the AO.
The security authorization package contains as a minimum the SSP (which includes the SCTM,
ConMon Strategy/Plan, and a RAR); the SAR; and the POA&M. Additional bodies of evidence
may be required, as directed by the AO. See Risk Assessment (RA) section for further details
regarding the Risk Assessment. The ISO is responsible for verifying that the security
authorization package is complete and is submitted for final review to the office of the AO. For
information systems inheriting common controls for specific security capabilities, the security
authorization package for the common controls or a reference to such documentation must also be
included in the authorization package. When security controls are provided to an organization by
an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business
arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization shall
ensure the information needed by the AO to make a risk-based decision is made available by the
control provider.
• Task 5-3: The AO, or designee, assesses the information provided in the security authorization
package regarding the current security state of the system to determine the risk to organizational
operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or national security.
Risk assessments (either formal or informal) may be employed to provide additional information
on threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts as well as the analyses for the risk mitigation
recommendations. The REF also provides information to the AO that is considered in the final
determination of risk resulting from the operation and use of the IS.
• Task 5-4: Determine if the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals,
other organizations, or national security is acceptable.
The explicit acceptance of risk is the responsibility of the AO. The AO will consider many
factors to determine if the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals,
other organizations, or national security is acceptable. Balancing security considerations with
mission and operational needs is paramount to achieving an acceptable authorization decision.
The AO will issue an authorization decision for the information system and the common controls
inherited by the system after reviewing all of the relevant information and, where appropriate,
consulting with other organizational officials.
The authorization decision document (ATO, denied authorization to operate (DATO), IATT)
conveys the final security authorization decision from the AO to the ISO, PSO and other
organizational officials, as appropriate. The authorization decision document contains the
following information:
• Authorization decision
• Terms and conditions for the authorization
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-37
• Authorization duration
o Time driven – AO may identify an expiration date
o Ongoing – Requires a robust and mature continuous monitoring plan
The security authorization decision indicates to the ISO (or other intended officials) whether the
system is issued an ATO, IATT, or DATO. The terms and conditions for the authorization
provide a description of any specific limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the
information system or inherited controls that must be followed by the ISO or CCP.
• Output from Step 5
o POA&M
o Security Authorization Package
o Authorization decision document
2.3.6 RMF Step 6, Monitor
An effective organizational information security program includes a continuous monitoring program
integrated into the SDLC in addition to conducting a thorough point-in-time assessment of the deployed
security controls. The objective of the continuous monitoring program is to determine if the set of
deployed security controls continue to be effective over time in light of the inevitable changes that occur
to the system and/or its operational environment.
An effective continuous monitoring program includes:
• Configuration management and control processes for information systems;
• Security impact analyses on proposed or actual changes to information systems and environments
of operation;
• Assessment of selected security controls (including system specific, hybrid, and common
controls) based on the defined continuous monitoring strategy;
• Security status reporting to appropriate officials; and
• Active involvement by authorizing officials in the ongoing management of information system-
related security risks.
Step 6 of the RMF focuses on monitoring the security controls associated with the information system
and includes the following tasks:
• Task 6-1: Determine the security impact of proposed or actual changes to the IS and its
environment of operation.
Changes to the IS or its environment of operation may affect the security controls currently in
place (including system specific, hybrid, and common controls), produce new vulnerabilities in
the system, or generate requirements for new security controls that were not needed previously.
The ISO ensures proposed or actual changes to an IS or its environment of operation are
documented. Assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the security state of the
system or the organization is an important aspect of security control monitoring and maintaining
the security authorization over time. The security impact analysis determines the extent to which
proposed or actual changes to the IS or its environment of operation affect the security state of the
system.
If the results of the security impact analysis indicate that the proposed or actual changes affect the
security state of the system, corrective actions must be initiated to include, but not limited to,
notifying the SCA of the proposed system changes or actual changes to the environment of
operations. The ISO ensures the change, potential impact, and recommended remediation, if
applicable, is documented. The SCA will determine required further actions. No security-related
changes to the IS or its environment of operation shall be implemented without first consulting
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-38
with appropriate organizational officials/entities (e.g., CCB, CISO, SCA). In addition, the
security authorization package shall be revised and updated as required.
The AO or designee uses the revised and updated SAR to determine if a formal reauthorization
action is necessary. Most routine changes to an information system or its environment of
operation can be handled by the organization’s continuous monitoring program, thus supporting
near real-time risk management. Conducting security impact analyses is part of an ongoing
assessment of risk.
• Task 6-2: Assess a selected subset of the security controls employed within and inherited by the
information system in accordance with the organization’s continuous monitoring strategy.
The selection of appropriate security controls to monitor and the frequency of monitoring are
based on the monitoring strategy developed by the ISO or CCP and approved by the AO. To
satisfy this requirement, organizations can draw upon the assessment results from any of the
following sources, including but not limited to:
o Security control assessments conducted as part of an information system authorization,
ongoing authorization, or formal reauthorization.
o Continuous monitoring activities to include self-assessments and/or security reviews.
o Testing and evaluation of the information system as part of the system development life
cycle process or audit.
The ISO is responsible for ensuring the results of continuous monitoring activities shall be
reported to the AO on an ongoing basis in the form of status reports.
• Task 6-3: Conduct remediation actions based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities,
assessment of risk, and outstanding items in the POA&M.
The ISO ensures remediation activities are conducted and documented as indicated in Task 6-4.
• Task 6-4: Update the SSP, SAR, and POA&M based on the results of the continuous monitoring
process.
The ISO shall ensure all relevant documentation is updated. The SSP/SCTM, RAR, and ConMon
frequency shall reflect any modifications to security controls based on risk mitigation activities
carried out by the ISO or CCP. Continuous monitoring status reports shall reflect additional
assessment activities carried out to determine security control effectiveness based on
modifications to the SSP and deployed controls. The updated POA&M shall report progress
made on the current outstanding items listed in the plan, address vulnerabilities discovered during
the security impact analysis or security control monitoring, and describe how the ISO or CCP
intends to address those vulnerabilities. The information provided by these critical updates helps
to raise awareness of the current security state of the IS (and the common controls inherited by
the system) thereby supporting the process of ongoing authorization and near real-time risk
management. When updating critical information in the SSP and POA&M, organizations shall
ensure that the original information needed for oversight, management, and auditing purposes is
not modified or destroyed.
• Task 6-5: Report the security status of the IS (including the effectiveness of security controls
employed within and inherited by the system) to the AO and other appropriate organization
officials on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy.
The ISO is responsible for reporting the security status of the IS. Reporting can be event driven,
time driven or both. The goal is efficient ongoing communication with senior leaders conveying
the current security state of the information system and its environment of operation with regard
to organizational missions and business functions. Security status reports shall be appropriately
marked, protected, and handled in accordance with federal and organizational policies.
Chapter 2-Risk Management Framework PAGE 2-39
• Task 6-6: Review the reported security status of IS (including the effectiveness of security
controls employed within and inherited by the systems) on an ongoing basis in accordance with
the organization’s continuous monitoring strategy.
This review by the AO or designee shall determine whether the risk to organizational operations,
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or national security remains acceptable.
By carrying out ongoing risk determination and risk acceptance, the AO can maintain the security
authorization over time.
• Task 6-7: Implement an IS decommissioning strategy, when needed, which executes required
actions when a system is removed from service.
The ISO shall ensure that all security controls addressing information system removal and
decommissioning (e.g., media sanitization, configuration management and control) are
implemented. A retention plan for records associated with the information system must be
proposed by the ISO and approved by the AO prior to destruction of the records. Organizational
tracking and management systems (including inventory systems) shall be updated to indicate the
specific IS components being removed from service. Users and application owners hosted on
decommissioned IS shall be notified as appropriate, and any security control inheritance
relationships shall be reviewed and assessed for impact. The ISO shall formally decommission
the IS by issuing a Decommission letter.
• Output from Step 6
o Periodic ConMon deliverables
o Updated SSP, SAR, POA&M
o Updated Security Authorization, as appropriate

3 POLICY AND PROCEDURES
EXCERPT FROM NIST SP 800-53 REVISION 4 APPENDIX F WITH OVERPRINT
GUIDANCE FOR THE SAP COMMUNITY
This chapter provides policy and procedures as they relate to each of the eighteen (18) security control
families defined in NIST SP 800-53.
Of the eighteen (18) security control families in NIST SP 800-53, seventeen (17) families are described in
NIST SP 800-53, Appendix F; one (1) additional family (Program Management [PM]) is addressed in
Appendix G and provides controls for information security programs. The PM family provides security
controls at the organizational rather than the information-system level and applies to all impact levels in
all baselines. The PM family is not listed in alphabetic order, but follows the SI family in this chapter. In
addition to the 18 families, NIST SP 800-53, Appendix J addresses Privacy and identifies an additional 8
control families. Reference the JSIG Chapter 2 discussion on overlays for guidance on Privacy. Each
security control family contains security controls related to the security functionality of the family. A
two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each security control family. Table 3-1
summarizes the families and the associated security control family identifiers.

PM Program Management
Table 3-1: Security Control Families and Identifiers
Security controls are identified by appending a numeric identifier to the family identifier to indicate the
number of the control within the family. For example, AC-2 is the second control in the Access Control
family, and CP-9 is the ninth control in the Contingency Planning family. Some controls have been
withdrawn and incorporated into other controls by NIST. Numbers associated with these controls remain
within each Security Control Family to maintain the numbering schema used in NIST SP 800-53, but are
identified as “withdrawn.
” Some controls are not included in any baseline; they may be added in as
required by overlay or tailoring requirements.
This chapter of the JSIG is comprised of the catalog of security controls from Appendix F of NIST SP
800-53 Revision 4. The original NIST text is preserved for the security control, control enhancement, and
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-41
supplemental guidance, where provided. The exception is where the NIST control (including the control
enhancement) indicates a requirement for the assignment of an organization-defined parameter value.
Where assigned, the JSCS WG (DoD SAP Community) organization-defined value appears in the control
text in bold, replacing the original italicized NIST verbiage. CNSSI 1253 defines values for a number of
controls requiring an organization-defined value. Where the JSCS WG determined the SAP Community
could/should align with the CNSS value, that value was captured in the control text of this JSIG. Where
it was determined that the SAP Community was better served by assigning a different or more articulate
value, that value appears in the control text in bold replacing the original italicized assignment verbiage as
stated above. If the original NIST assignment text is still in place, it was determined that the
organization-defined parameter value should be assigned at the organization or system level and not at the
SAP Community level. Assignment at the organization or system level provides an opportunity for an
organization to tailor the security controls to support specific mission, business, or operational needs. See
control AC-5 used as an example below.
Control ID and Control Title
a. b. c. SAP Assigned Organization
Value (bold)
AC-5 SEPARATION OF DUTIES
Control: The organization:
NIST Control Verbiage
Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals], at a minimum, to ensure system
administrators shall not also perform security audit administration functions and Media
Custodians shall not perform DTA functions without specific AO approval;
NIST Assignment to
Documents separation of duties of individuals; and
Organization (italics)
Defines information system access authorizations to support
separation of duties.
Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for
abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent
activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i)
dividing mission functions and information system support functions
among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information
system support functions with different individuals (e.g., system
management, programming, configuration management, quality
assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security
personnel administering access control functions do not also administer
audit functions. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3, PE-4, PS-2.
NIST Supplemental
Guidance
Different privileged accounts should be assigned for different
roles. Organizations should separate roles for network or
database administration from other sensitive functions, such as
cryptographic key management, hardware management,
removable media data transfer, system security management,
or access to particularly sensitive information.
SAP Supplemental Guidance
(text box)
As shown in the example above, SAP guidance for a given control or control enhancement is provided in
a textbox and located following the relevant control or control enhancement in the catalog of controls
below. The focus for providing additional SAP guidance is on controls that are included in a moderate-
low-low (MLL) or moderate-moderate-low (MML) baseline, and only as needed. Not all controls will
have a textbox because NIST supplemental guidance frequently provides sufficient guidance.
The AO may authorize or require tailoring of controls based on risks identified to the information,
information system and/or its environment of operation. Tailoring may include compensatory measures
or manual procedures in lieu of automated/technical solutions. The SSP/SCTM must address those
situations where tailoring methods are implemented. Tailoring must be approved in writing by the AO or
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-42
designee. Tailored controls should be reviewed at least annually as part of the continuous monitoring
process.
The JSIG provides policy and procedures within each control family in the sections that follow.
Therefore, the JSIG may be cited for compliance with the -1 policy controls for each family in addition to
organization, site, and program specific policy. Policy and procedures applicable to multiple systems at a
given site/campus may be captured in an IA SOP as required by the respective AO with additional policy
and procedures specific to the system captured in the SSP/SCTM. In addition to the JSIG, service/agency
specific policies and procedures may be required. Organization-defined parameter values within the JSIG
are assigned for the DoD SAP Community through the JSCS WG and are applicable to DoD SAP systems
if not otherwise defined by formal organization policy or tailored with AO approval.
FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL
AC-1 a. 2. b. ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access
controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Access control policy annually or as policy and procedures dictate changes are required; and
Access control procedures annually or as policy and procedures dictate changes are required.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to access control are defined in the
remainder of this control family.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. AC-2 ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization:
Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational
missions/business functions: as defined by the service or program;
Assigns account managers for information system accounts;
Establishes conditions for group and role membership;
Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access
authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;
b. c. d. Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-43
e. f. g. i. j. k. Requires approvals by ISO or designee for requests to create information system accounts;
Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with the
service or program policy;
Monitors the use of information system accounts;
h. Notifies account managers:
1. When accounts are no longer required;
2. When users are terminated or transferred; and
3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;
Authorizes access to the information system based on:
1. A valid access authorization;
2. Intended system usage; and
3. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;
Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements at least annually; and
Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are
removed from the group.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group,
system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of
the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information
systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access
privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring
administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate
organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer)
responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access
privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes
required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-
of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g.,
scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences,
customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors
could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for
short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation
procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account
activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for
rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used
accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network
resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or
removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when
shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are
transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.

Types of Accounts
System/Service Accounts
System accounts are internal accounts that are used by the operating system and by services
that run under the control of the operating system. There are many services and processes
within the operating system that need the capability to log on internally utilizing a service
account. System/service accounts shall not be added to any general user groups and shall not
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-44
have general user rights assigned to them.
Temporary/Emergency Accounts
Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts that are established for individuals not
previously identified in the information system, such as inspectors, assessment team
members, vendor personnel or consultants, who may require access to the system, for
example, to conduct assessment, maintenance or diagnostic activities with little or no notice.
Based on a prior assessment of risk, organizations may establish temporary or emergency
accounts for these individuals. The ISO or designee must approve the creation of temporary
or emergency accounts. Temporary and emergency accounts may be for one-time use or for
a very limited time period. The ISSM/ISSO/SA must be notified when temporary or
emergency accounts are no longer needed, see [AC-2(2)]. See PL-4 for Rules of Behavior
for users.
General User Accounts
A general user account is provided to an individual who can receive information from, input
information to, or modify information on a system.
Privileged User Accounts
A privileged user account is provided to an individual who is authorized to perform security-
relevant functions, such as system control, monitoring, data transfer, or administration
functions that general users are not authorized to perform.
Account Creation
The ISO or designee identifies the individual(s) authorized to assign the user account
identifier and authenticator(s) to system users. The supervisor must ensure all individual
access requests are valid and access is work/mission-related.
Prior to granting access to any information system, the individual responsible for account
creation and/or changes to access permissions shall verify that the user to whom access is
being granted is appropriately cleared and indoctrinated to all levels of information that will
be accessible, and that the user is in compliance with personnel security requirements. This
verification shall be done via the local SAP Security or Program Manager (PM) as
applicable. In addition, the ISSM/ISSO or SA responsible for account creation shall ensure
that only accesses and privileges validated by the requestor’s supervisor are granted, [AC-
2.c] [AC-2.d] [AC-2.i]. See also Identifier Management [IA-4] and Authenticator
Management [IA-5].
User Account Disabling/Deletion [AC-2.f]
All user accounts must be disabled, generally within 24 hours, when information system
users are terminated, transferred, or no longer require access to the information resource in
the performance of their assigned duties. When a user’s security clearance is revoked due to
an incident or violation, the user’s account must be disabled immediately. Disabled accounts
shall be removed within 12 months or one review cycle, whichever is longer. Organizations
must ensure that information deemed to be of value is retained before a user’s account is
deleted.
Group Accounts [AC-2.k; AC-2(9); AC-2(10)]
In general, group accounts are prohibited. The use of group accounts/authenticators
precludes the association of a particular act with the individual who initiated that act, i.e.,
individual accountability. Situations should be avoided in which the group
account/authenticator is effectively the sole access control mechanism for the system.
However, use of group accounts/authenticators for broader access after the use of a unique
authenticator for initial identification and authentication carries much less risk. The use of
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-45
group accounts/authenticators shall be explicitly authorized by the AO or designated
representative.
Exceptions to this policy may include the use of group accounts in tactical/deployed
environments. Use of group accounts in a tactical/watch standing environment allows rapid
interchange between users whose primary focus is quick access to the system without
interruption of functions or capabilities. This also avoids the potential for errors on startup as
the system is shut down and restarted for a different user to logon. A list shall be used for
watch stander rotations or battle station assignments, which must be retained and used to
augment activity logs to correlate user identities to actions as recorded on audit logs. An
alternative involves the development of a simple pop-up “change USERID” Graphical User
Interface (GUI) which does not cause the system to shut down or change operations. This
alternative simply changes accountability via the new USERID/password for continuing
processes under another individual member of a common functional group. Reference IA-2
and IA-2(5).
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text
messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using
the information system to monitor account usage; and using telephonic notification to report atypical
system account usage.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | REMOVAL OF TEMPORARY / EMERGENCY ACCOUNTS
The information system automatically disables temporary and emergency accounts after not to exceed 72 hours.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and
emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at the
convenience of the systems administrator.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE INACTIVE ACCOUNTS
The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after not to exceed ninety (90) days.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED AUDIT ACTIONS
The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions,
and notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | INACTIVITY LOGOUT
The organization requires that users log out when user’s work day has ended or there is an extended absence
(more than six (6) hours).
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-23.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT
The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management capabilities: [Assignment:
organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities].
Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ static
information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access control approaches
(e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic
privilege management. While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges
may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business requirements and operational needs of
organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of
privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect
any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change
the privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of
privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if users are operating
out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress or in emergency
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-46
(7) maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege
changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for communications. Dynamic
privilege management can support requirements for information system resiliency. Related control:
AC-16.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ROLE-BASED SCHEMES
The organization:
(a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme that
organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;
Monitors privileged role assignments; and
Takes the following action: Disables (or revokes) privileged user accounts when privileged role
assignments are no longer appropriate.
Supplemental Guidance: Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not
authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management, account
management, network and system administration, database administration, and web administration.
(b) (c) Organizations shall establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with
a role-based access scheme that organizes information system and network privileges
into roles; and tracks and monitors privileged role assignments. [AC-2(7)(a)], [AC-
2(7)(b)] Privileged roles also include auditor and data transfer agent (DTA).
(8) (9) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION
The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts]
dynamically.
Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as
implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing accounts (identities) at run
time for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for dynamic creation of
information system accounts by establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the appropriate
authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges. Related control: AC-16.
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED GROUPS / ACCOUNTS
The organization only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet [Assignment: organization-defined
conditions for establishing shared/group accounts].
See also supplemental guidance for AC-2.k.
(10) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL TERMINATION
The information system terminates shared/group account credentials when members leave the group.
See also supplemental guidance for AC-2.k.
(11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | USAGE CONDITIONS
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage conditions] for
[Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can describe the specific conditions or circumstances under
which information system accounts can be used, for example, by restricting usage to certain days of the
week, time of day, or specific durations of time.
(12) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE
The organization:
a. b. Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical use]; and
Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems at certain
times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of
individuals working in organizations. Related control: CA-7.
(13) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS
The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within 30 minutes of discovery of the risk.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-47
Supplemental Guidance: Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom
reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to information
systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse
impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Close
coordination between authorizing officials, information system administrators, and human resource
managers is essential in order for timely execution of this control enhancement. Related control: PS-4.
See also AU-6.
References: None.
AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information
and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, control
matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on
behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, domains) in information
systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and recognizing that
information systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational missions and
business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service
level to provide increased information security. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-16, AC-
17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, AC-21, AC-22, AU-9, CM-5, CM-6, CM-11, MA-3, MA-4, MA-5, PE-3.
All information systems shall, at a minimum, enforce a discretionary access control (DAC)
policy that covers the requirements of AC-3(4).
For periods processing, consider tailoring in [SC-4(2)].
Additional access enforcement controls apply to mobile computing devices, certain
compartmentalized data as defined by the Data Owner, and CDS. See also Protection of
Information at Rest [SC-28], Access Control for Mobile Devices [AC-19], and CDS in
Information Flow Enforcement [AC-4].
Access by Foreign Nationals - DoD SAP information is not releasable to foreign nationals
except as authorized by the respective service/agency SAPCO.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | RESTRICTED ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6].
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
The information system enforces dual authorization for all transfers of data from a classified computer network
to removable media.
Supplemental Guidance: Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized
individuals in order to execute. Organizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms when
immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and environmental safety. Dual authorization may
also be known as two-person control. Related controls: CP-9, MP-6.
Data transfer authorization enforcement can be performed by the organization, but
should have technical separation of roles to support the organization’s implemented dual
authorization process. Example of implementation meeting the spirit of AC-3(2): The
organization policy states that appropriately trained Data Transfer Agents (DTAs) are the
only individuals authorized to transfer data from a classified system to removable media.
Only System Administrators are authorized to enable permissions to transfer removable
media.
Media Custodians are not authorized to be DTAs.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-48
(3) (4) (4) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access control policies] over all
subjects and objects where the policy specifies that:
(a) The policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the information system;
(b) A subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the following;
(1) Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;
(2) Granting its privileges to other subjects;
(3) Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or information
system components;
Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with newly created or modified
objects; or
(5) Changing the rules governing access control; and
(c) [Assignment: Organized-defined subjects] may explicitly be granted [Assignment: organization-defined
privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)] such that they are not limited by some or all of the above constraints.
Supplemental Guidance: Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is
synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only to certain historical uses
(e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model). The above class of mandatory access control
policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for
which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the
information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also
constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges;
that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly
enforced over all subjects and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the
access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an
implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the
information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system,
additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect).
The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least
privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above
policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most applicable
when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that
establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and some users of the
information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified information resident in the
information system. This control can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (4). A subject that is
constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less
rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less
rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a
constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different
sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same
sensitivity label as the subject. Related controls: AC-25, SC-11.
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control policies] over
defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information
can do one or more of the following:
(a) Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;
(b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;
(c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information system’s
components;
Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or
Change the rules governing access control.
Supplemental Guidance: When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not
constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already
(d) (e) Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-49
been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented
from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects.
This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (3). A subject that is constrained in its
operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of
this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing
information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to
pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the
information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information
system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the
older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control,
that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.
The policy shall address at a minimum:
• Allows users to specify and control sharing by named individuals or groups of
individuals, or by both[AC-3(4)(a)];
• Limits propagation of access rights [AC-3(4)(b)]; and
• Includes or excludes access to the granularity of a single user. [AC-3(4)(c)]
(5) (6) (7) (8) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION
The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information] except
during secure, non-operable system states.
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant information is any information within information systems
that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a
manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or maintain the isolation of code
and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls,
cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for security services, and access
control lists. Secure, non-operable system states include the times in which information systems are not
performing mission/business-related processing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance,
troubleshooting, boot-up, shut down). Related control: CM-3.
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | PROTECTION OF USER AND SYSTEM INFORMATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-4 and SC-28].
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
The information system enforces a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and controls
access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users authorized to assume such roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that restricts
information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create specific roles based on job
functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on organizational
information systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the
organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC
simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to
every user (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but
are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or
discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access
controls, the requirements in AC-3 (3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the
policy.
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS
The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes to the security
attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules governing the timing of
revocations of access authorizations].
Supplemental Guidance: Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access revoked. For
example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group, access may not be revoked until
the next time the object (e.g., file) is opened or until the next time the subject attempts a new access to
the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels may take effect immediately. Organizations
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-50
can provide alternative approaches on how to make revocations immediate if information systems
cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation is necessary.
(9) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE
The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary unless:
(a) The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component] provides
[Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and
(b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the appropriateness of the
information designated for release.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can only protect organizational information within the
confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be needed to ensure
that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established information
system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting
information to an external information system or printing the information on one of its printers. In
cases where the information system is unable to make a determination of the adequacy of the
protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine
procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The means
used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information systems include, for
example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization
and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect
the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means
employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the
information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural
means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the
information system passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical
means are employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information are
appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a
printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only
appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most
applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that
establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the realm of a
particular information system or organization.
(10) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | AUDITED OVERRIDE OF ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS
The organization employs an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under [Assignment:
organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-6.
References: None.
AC-4 INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT
Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information
within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined
information flow control policies].
Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an
information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the
information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control
restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear
to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web
requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers
between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information
systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such
transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards
provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations
consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-51
(i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows;
and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.
Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control
the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and
devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the
characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in
boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule
sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering
capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g.,
implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the
trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)
that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address
cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and
stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-
assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information
technology products. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-6, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2, SC-5, SC-
7, SC-18.
Information flow enforcement is addressed through the use of controlled interfaces (CI),
including CDS, and assured file transfers (AFT). AFTs require data tracking logs for all
transfers and a trained DTA.
Controlled Interface (CI)
A CI is a mechanism that facilitates adjudicating the security policies of different
interconnected information systems (e.g., controlling the flow of information into or out of
an interconnected system; often referred to as a guard). [CNSSI 4009]
Controlling the flow of information into an interconnected system helps preserve the
integrity of the system, and the integrity and confidentiality of the information maintained
and processed by the system. Controlling the flow of information out of the system helps
preserve the confidentiality of the information leaving the system, and may protect the
integrity of the receiving system.
Controlled interfaces that control the flow of information out of an IS are often employed to
facilitate push technology, where the goal is to push information to an indirect user residing
outside of the system perimeter (equipment responsibility demarcation), but within the
system boundary (users).
The adjudication of integrity and confidentiality policies may be handled in a variety of
ways. For example, a single CI may perform all of the confidentiality and integrity
adjudication; or one CI may be employed for adjudicating confidentiality policies while
another adjudicates integrity policies; or the adjudication of confidentiality and integrity
policies may be distributed across a set of CI where each performs some subset of
confidentiality and integrity policy adjudication.
While a CI is often implemented as a mechanism (or a set of mechanisms) separate from the
systems it is intended to protect, this need not be the case. A CI can be constructed so that
some of its functionality resides in the systems themselves. The term CI includes CDS,
routers, firewalls, etc. The classification of the domains, to include the criteria to release
data, is an indicator of what type of CI is required. See AC-4(20)
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-52
Cross Domain Solution (CDS)
A CDS is a form of controlled interface, utilizing a trusted operating system and
enforcing a security policy to provide access to and/or transfer data between different
security domains. A CDS requires a higher level of assurance, both from a hardware and
software perspective.
In the most simplistic terms a CDS is a set of mechanisms that implement the capabilities to
access or transfer information (manually or automatically) between two or more security
domains and enforce their security policies. This means the end points of the cross domain
interconnections operate under different security policies with regard to classification, access
or releasability of information. For example, when two information systems and/or networks
of different security domains are connected together enabling access and/or data-flow
between them, a CDS is mandatory and placed between the two domains.
A well-designed CDS prevents untrusted and potentially malicious data from entering the
network of the higher classification and prevents data of a higher classification from leaking
into the network of a lower classification.
The creation, validation (assessment and authorization), and life cycle support of a CDS can
be time consuming and resource intensive. In 2006 as a result of urgent operational demands
to share information more effectively across security domains throughout the federal
government, the DoD and the IC CIOs established an interagency office – the Unified Cross
Domain Services Management Office (UCDSMO), which focuses on delivering modern
cross domain capabilities to the field.
The primary function of the UCDSMO is to provide centralized coordination and oversight
of all cross domain activities and ensure a common approach for the implementation of cross
domain capabilities within the DoD and the IC. This means the UCDSMO will provide and
maintain a list of supported CDS which are certified and fully documented (body of
evidence) and a sunset list of CDS that are at the end of their life cycle. The UCDSMO-
supported CDS still require authorization on a case-by-case basis by your respective AO.
Contact the AO during initial CDS discussions, i.e., during the Pre-acquisition phase, and
prior to engaging the UCDSMO. See AC-4(20)
CDS Types
To help determine what type of CDS is required, the UCDSMO-supported CDS are divided
into three functional types:
• Data Transfer Solutions: Used to interconnect networks or information systems that
operate in different security domains and transfer information between them.
• Access Solutions: Used to provide simultaneous visualization of information from
multiple security domains via a single workstation without any data transfer between
the various domains.
• Multi-Level Solutions: Used to store data in multiple security domains at varied
security levels and allow users to access the data at an appropriate security level.
A requirement to share information between different security domains requires AO
coordination for selection, authorization, and connection approval.
Assured File Transfers (AFT)
There are two types of data transfers: Low-to-High and High-to-Low. Documented and AO
approved data transfer procedures are required for both types.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-53
Low-to-High is defined as a transfer from a lower classification system to a higher
classification system and also includes data transferred between two like security domains,
e.g., S//SAR-A/SAR-B/SAR-C to S//SAR-A/SAR-B/SAR-C.
High-to-Low is defined as a transfer from a higher classification system to a lower
classification system. It also includes a transfer between systems of the same classification
with a differing set of programs, i.e., different security domains, for example, between
TS//SAR-A/SAR-B/SAR-C and TS//SAR-A/SAR-B/SAR-J.
Conducting manual data transfers between security domains can be a time consuming, labor
intensive process and must be done methodically and accurately to assure integrity of the
source information, assure that only the data identified for transfer is transferred, prevent
introduction of malicious software, and to prevent data spills. Careless methods, shortcuts,
and untrained users have compromised sensitive and classified information vital to national
security, mission success, and operational processes. AFT procedures are established to
mitigate the risks associated with all aspects of this activity and are conducted by individuals
trained in the risks associated with transferring data between disparate security domains. The
DTA is responsible for understanding the risks involved in data transfers and following the
AFT procedures to ensure any potential risk is managed during the download and transfer
process. (Reference AT-3 for AFT/DTA training.) The subject matter expert (SME) is an
individual knowledgeable of the program and the classification of information associated
with it and is responsible for ensuring the file is reviewed and sanitized of all program-
related data.
All new and reused media must be virus scanned prior to starting an AFT.
Data Transfer Tracking
All data transfers (e.g., low to high, high to low) must be tracked to include date, originator
making request, filename, file format, classification level, source and destination systems,
and approver.
A Low to High transfer requires:
• Log for transfers from a lower classified system (Secret or Top Secret) to a higher
classified system, e.g., Secret to Top Secret or S//SAR-A/SAR-B to S//SAR-A/SAR-
B/SAR-C. Data transferred from an unclassified system must be logged, e.g., vendor
software updates or antivirus definition files from Non-secure Internet Protocol
Router Network (NIPRNet).
• Two (2) virus/malware scans. The first scan is performed once the file(s) is
downloaded to the media on the originating system; the second scan is performed on
the media on the target system prior to uploading the file to the system. When
possible, use virus/malware scanning products from different vendors.
• Testing of the write protect mechanism. Once media is introduced on the High side,
the capability to write to the media must be tested to ensure the media cannot be
written to. If the test fails and the media is written to on the High side, then the
media must be classified at the higher classification level.
A separate standalone system for scanning may be used if documented in the approved data
transfer procedures.
High to Low transfer requires:
• A log documenting date, originator making request, filename and format type (e.g.,
.doc, .xls, .pdf), classification level, DTA who performed transfer, SME who
performed review, originating system, target system, and approver.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-54
• Documented mission justification.
• As a community best practice, use of an automated review tool in lieu of a manual
transfer process (e.g., checklist).
• AO approval for use of automated tools or a manual transfer process/checklist.
• A PSO approved key word list.
AFT tools should not be confused with forensic tools. Forensic tools are ‘discovery’ tools
designed for investigation and recovery (e.g., hard drive data), while keeping the files
forensically sound and unchanged. An AFT tool performs a deep file inspection into the
many complex layers and, in the case of Microsoft Office, the nearly 100 areas where MS
Office products store data within a file, also known as metadata. The tool then provides the
SME with a ‘what you see is what you get’ or WYSIWYG view. In addition, the AFT tools
address cropped, resized, and hidden images and graphics through a
cleansing/flattening/resolution process. AFT tools identify the exact location (page/
paragraph) of keyword hits and cropped/resized graphics. Forensic tools find images and
graphics as well as keywords, but do not identify their location, nor do they indicate if an
image/graphic was cropped, resized, or hidden.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES
The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated with [Assignment:
organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce [Assignment: organization-defined
information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes
associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects, and
respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms encounter
information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For example, an information
object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled Secret, but an
information object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled
Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source and destination addresses employed in
traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for example, to
control the release of certain types of information. Related control: AC-16.
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PROCESSING DOMAINS
The information system uses protected processing domains to enforce [Assignment: organization-defined information
flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: Within information systems, protected processing domains are processing
spaces that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, thus enabling control of
information flows between these spaces and to/from data/information objects. A protected processing
domain can be provided, for example, by implementing domain and type enforcement. In domain and
type enforcement, information system processes are assigned to domains; information is identified by
types; and information flows are controlled based on allowed information accesses (determined by
domain and type), allowed signaling among domains, and allowed process transitions to other
domains.
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL
The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-defined
policies].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control include, for
example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions or
mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in
organizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs, changes in
the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events. Related control: SI-4.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-55
(4) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION
The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by [Selection
(one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating communications
sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; [Assignment: organization-defined procedure or method]].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SI-4.
(5) (6) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | EMBEDDED DATA TYPES
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations] on embedding data types within
other data types.
Supplemental Guidance: Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced flow
control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes, for example, inserting executable files as objects
within word processing files, inserting references or descriptive information into a media file, and
compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded data types. Limitations on data
type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit levels of data type embedding that are
beyond the capability of the inspection tools.
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA
The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-defined metadata].
Supplemental Guidance: Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data. Metadata
can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax, and semantics) or
descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone number). Enforcing
allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more effective flow control.
Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to data accuracy (i.e., knowledge
that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against
unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring
sufficiently strong binding techniques with appropriate levels of assurance). Related controls: AC-16,
SI-7.
(7) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ONE-WAY FLOW MECHANISMS
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way flows] using hardware mechanisms.
(8) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined security policy
filters] as a basis for flow control decisions for [Assignment: organization-defined information flows].
Supplemental Guidance: Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures and
content. For example, security policy filters for data structures can check for maximum file lengths,
maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data). Security policy filters
for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word filters), enumerated values or data
value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the interpretation of data content by
applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital information without a particular data structure
or with a data structure that does not facilitate the development of rule sets to address the particular
sensitivity of the information conveyed by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions.
Unstructured data consists of: (i) bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e., image,
video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g.,
commercial off-the-shelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can
implement more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g.,
employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false positives).
(9) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | HUMAN REVIEWS
The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment: organization-defined information flows]
under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where automated
flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow control decision is not possible, then
a human review may be employed in lieu of, or as a complement to, automated security policy
filtering. Human reviews may also be employed as deemed necessary by organizations.
(10) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable [Assignment:
organization-defined security policy filters] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined
conditions].
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-56
Supplemental Guidance: For example, as allowed by the information system authorization,
administrators can enable security policy filters to accommodate approved data types.
(11) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONFIGURATION OF SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to configure [Assignment: organization-
defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.
Supplemental Guidance: For example, to reflect changes in security policies, administrators can change
the list of “dirty words” that security policy mechanisms check in accordance with the definitions
provided by organizations.
(12) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, uses [Assignment:
organization-defined data type identifiers] to validate data essential for information flow decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: Data type identifiers include, for example, filenames, file types, file
signatures/tokens, and multiple internal file signatures/tokens. Information systems may allow transfer
of data only if compliant with data type format specifications.
(13) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, decomposes information
into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents] for submission to policy enforcement
mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or sanitization
rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow enforcement prior to
transferring such information to different security domains. Parsing transfer files facilitates policy
decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification, attachments, and other security-related
component differentiators.
(14) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTER CONSTRAINTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, implements [Assignment:
organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated formats that restrict data structure and content.
Supplemental Guidance: Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential malicious
and/or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security policy filters that restrict data
structures include, for example, restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data content policy filters
include, for example: (i) encoding formats for character sets (e.g., Universal Character Set
Transformation Formats, American Standard Code for Information Interchange); (ii) restricting
character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters; (iii) prohibiting special characters; and
(iv) validating schema structures.
(15) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DETECTION OF UNSANCTIONED INFORMATION
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, examines the information
for the presence of [Assignment: organized-defined unsanctioned information] and prohibits the transfer of such
information in accordance with the [Assignment: organization-defined security policy].
Supplemental Guidance: Detection of unsanctioned information includes, for example, checking all
information to be transferred for malicious code and dirty words. Related control: SI-3.
(16) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | INFORMATION TRANSFERS ON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-4].
(17) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION
The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by [Selection (one or
more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.
Supplemental Guidance: Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations. The
ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information systems, allows
the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy compliance by attributing
policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful domain authentication requires that
information system labels distinguish among systems, organizations, and individuals involved in
preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating information. Related controls: IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5.
(18) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING
The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organization-defined binding
techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-57
Supplemental Guidance: Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the strength of
security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding
techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in the information flow enforcement
process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by
organizations. Related controls: AC-16, SC-16.
(19) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, applies the same security
policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the validation of metadata and the data to
which the metadata applies. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and data payloads (i.e.,
only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not make such distinctions,
considering metadata and the data to which the metadata applies as part of the payload. All information
(including metadata and the data to which the metadata applies) is subject to filtering and inspection.
(20) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | APPROVED SOLUTIONS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined solutions in approved configurations] to control the flow
of [Assignment: organization-defined information] across security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define approved solutions and configurations in cross-domain
policies and guidance in accordance with the types of information flows across classification
boundaries. The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) provides a baseline listing of
approved cross-domain solutions.
UCDMO is now Unified Cross Domain Services Management Office (UCDSMO).
(21) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS
The information system separates information flows logically or physically using [Assignment: organization-defined
mechanisms and/or techniques] to accomplish [Assignment: organization-defined required separations by types of
information].
Supplemental Guidance: Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance protection
by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling flow control by
transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable information include, for
example, inbound and outbound communications traffic, service requests and responses, and
information of differing security categories.
(22) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ACCESS ONLY
The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data residing
on multiple different security domains, while preventing any information flow between the different security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: The information system, for example, provides a desktop for users to access
each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow transfer of information
between the different security domains.
References: None.
a. b. c. AC-5 SEPARATION OF DUTIES
Control: The organization:
Separates at a minimum, duties of system administrators from audit administration functions;
and duties of DTAs from media custodians;
Documents separation of duties of individuals; and
Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.
Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and
helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for
example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support functions among different
individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with different individuals
(e.g., system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and
network security); and (iii) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also
administer audit functions. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3, PE-4, PS-2.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-58
Different privileged accounts should be assigned for different roles. Organizations should
separate roles for network or database administration from other sensitive functions, such as
cryptographic key management, hardware management, removable media data transfer,
system security management, or access to particularly sensitive information.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
AC-6 LEAST PRIVILEGE
Control: The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for
users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in
accordance with organizational missions and business functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems.
The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes
operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational
missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and
information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least
privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.
Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-2.
For example, system administrators, security administrators, and database administrators
perform functions that do not require use of their fully privileged account. They shall,
therefore, use a separate general user account and are required to use that account when not
performing privileged functions. [AC-6(2)] Individual email accounts should not be used
when logged in as a privileged user.
Other examples of least privilege include restricting access to audit logs to security auditors,
preventing general users from installing software, and/or limiting access to media drives to
DTAs that have been formally trained.
Control Enhancements:
(1) LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS
The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in
hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information]).
Supplemental Guidance: Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts,
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and
setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering
rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for
security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example,
security administrators, system and network administrators, system security officers, system
maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users. Related controls: AC-17,
AC-18, AC-19.
One example of this is authorizing access to specific system endpoints, such as access to
USB ports, CD/DVD drives, microphones, and cameras as well as least privilege on
ability to make changes to port security implemented on switches. Additional roles on the
network must also be considered.
All classified information systems must technically enforce restrictions on the ability to
write to removable media. By default, all write functionality must be disabled. Whenever
access to writable removable media is necessary, the write functionality may be enabled,
but this must be logged. After the write functions are completed, the write functionality
must again be disabled and logged.
Ensure media access is audited as indicated in AU-2.a.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-59
This control is non-tailorable for all SAP systems.
(2) (3) (4) (5) LEAST PRIVILEGE | NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS
The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to privileged functions
(except the DTA role), use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within
privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement
access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same
degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on
behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.
Related control: PL-4.
LEAST PRIVILEGE | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS
The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands] only for
[Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and documents the rationale for such access in the
security plan for the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local
access (i.e., user being physically present at the device). Related control: AC-17.
LEAST PRIVILEGE | SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS
The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.
Supplemental Guidance: Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user
privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional privileges
within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying
actual machine; (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation mechanisms; and (iii)
implementing separate physical domains. Related controls: AC-4, SC-3, SC-30, SC-32.
LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to absolute minimum number of
privileged users needed to manage the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as
system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting
privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to
privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this control
enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided
organizations retain the ability to control information system configurations for key security
parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. Related control: CM-6.
In addition, super-user/root privileges shall be limited to the maximum extent possible.
For example, not all privileged users will be granted full super-user/root access.
(6) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS
The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational users.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: IA-8.
Reference IA-2 for definition of organizational user.
(7) LEAST PRIVILEGE | REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES
The organization:
(a) Reviews at least annually the privileges assigned to privileged user accounts including DTA role to validate
the need for such privileges; and
(b) Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission/business needs.
Supplemental Guidance: The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time reflecting
changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation, technologies, or
threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for
assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take
appropriate corrective actions. Related control: CA-7.
The Presidential Memo, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for
Insider Threat Programs, November 21, 2012, and DoDD 5205.16, The DoD Insider
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-60
Threat Program, 30 Sep 2014, require that organizations develop insider threat programs
to include reporting the status of privileged users (e.g., total number, additions, deletions)
on a quarterly basis.
(8) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION
The information system prevents software applications/programs from executing at higher privilege levels than
users executing the software.
Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with
elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for execution are
at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such
applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by
organizations.
The context of this enhancement is in the basic control where it states "or processes
acting on behalf of users." This enhancement typically overlaps with and enables AC-
6(1). Both Windows and Linux distinguish between normal user level privilege and
privileged user privilege (admin and root).
Example: To maintain system integrity most systems restrict the ability of an application
to install other software (including reinstalling itself). Windows users (from Vista on)
are familiar with User Account Control (UAC) popup or the need to right click and "Run
as Administrator" in order to install an application. Linux users are familiar with an "su"
or "sudo" to root privilege to install applications.
Another example is the Windows registry editor that runs for all users, but only allows
editing of the registry values authorized for each user.
Even for privileged users, it is not uncommon to find that the audit management and
backup applications only execute for users in the assigned groups.
Some software requires privileged escalation by design, such as the Unix password
program; ensure AC-6(8) is tailored to document those programs, as applicable.
(9) (10) LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS
The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system
accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help
mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT). Related control: AU-2.
LEAST PRIVILEGE | PROHIBIT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS
The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling,
circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.
Supplemental Guidance: Privileged functions include, for example, establishing information system
accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management
activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations.
Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection
mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.
References: None.
AC-7 UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS
Control: The information system:
Enforces a limit of maximum of three (3) consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a
fifteen (15) minute time period; and
a. Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-61
b. Automatically locks the account/node until released by an administrator when the maximum
number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network
connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by information systems
are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time period established by
organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to employ different algorithms for
different information system components based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to
unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application levels.
Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5.
If (b) is not supported locally, then the account/node shall be automatically locked for a
minimum of 15 minutes.
Control Enhancements:
(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7].
(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE / WIPE MOBILE DEVICE
The information system purges/wipes information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices] based on
[Assignment: organization-defined purging/wiping requirements/techniques] after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful
device logon attempts.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies only to mobile devices for which a logon
occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets). The logon is to the mobile device, not to
any one account on the device. Therefore, successful logons to any accounts on mobile devices reset
the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Organizations define information to be purged/wiped carefully in
order to avoid over purging/wiping which may result in devices becoming unusable. Purging/wiping
may be unnecessary if the information on the device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption
mechanisms. Related controls: AC-19, MP-5, MP-6, SC-13.
References: None.
AC-8 SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION
Control: The information system:
a. Displays to users DoD Information Systems Standard Consent Banner before granting access to the system that
provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, and guidance and states that:
1. Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system;
2. Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
3. Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil
penalties; and
4. Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;
Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions
and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system; and
c. For publicly accessible systems:
1. Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined conditions], before granting
further access;
Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy
accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.
Supplemental Guidance: System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners
displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are used only for
b. 2. 3. Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-62
access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
Organizations consider system use notification messages/banners displayed in multiple languages based on
specific organizational needs and the demographics of information system users. Organizations also consult
with the Office of the General Counsel for legal review and approval of warning banner content.
Control Enhancements: None.
In accordance with DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, March 14, 2014, Enclosure 3, paragraph
9(1)(d), Notice and Consent Banners: “Standard mandatory notice and consent banners must
be displayed at logon to all ISs and standard mandatory consent notice and consent
provisions will be included in all DoD IS user agreements in accordance with applicable
security controls and DoD implementation procedures.” The required text for the banner and
user agreements is posted to DISA’s Information Assurance Support Environment (IASE)
website under “DoD Consent Banner” at http://iase.disa.mil.
References: None.
AC-9 PREVIOUS LOGON (ACCESS) NOTIFICATION
Control: The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon (access) to the system, of the date
and time of the last logon (access).
Supplemental Guidance: This control is applicable to logons to information systems via human user
interfaces and logons to systems that occur in other types of architectures (e.g., service-oriented
architectures). Related controls: AC-7, PL-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | UNSUCCESSFUL LOGONS
The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon/access, of the number of unsuccessful logon/access
attempts since the last successful logon/access.
PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | SUCCESSFUL / UNSUCCESSFUL LOGONS
The information system notifies the user of the number of successful logons/accesses; unsuccessful
logon/access attempts during the period since last successful logon.
PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | NOTIFICATION OF ACCOUNT CHANGES
The information system notifies the user of changes to [Assignment: organization-defined security-related
characteristics/parameters of the user’s account] during the period since last successful logon
PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION | ADDITIONAL LOGON INFORMATION
The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon (access), of the following additional information:
[Assignment: organization-defined information to be included in addition to the date and time of the last logon
(access)].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement permits organizations to specify additional
information to be provided to users upon logon including, for example, the location of last logon. User
location is defined as that information which can be determined by information systems, for example,
IP addresses from which network logons occurred, device identifiers, or notifications of local logons.
References: None.
AC-10 CONCURRENT SESSION CONTROL
Control: The information system limits the number of concurrent sessions for each non-privileged and
privileged to maximum of three (3) sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for
information system accounts globally, by account type (e.g., privileged user, non-privileged user, domain,
specific application), by account, or a combination. For example, organizations may limit the number of
concurrent sessions for system administrators or individuals working in particularly sensitive domains or
mission-critical applications. This control addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts
and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-63
This control may require third party software or development of a script.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
a. b. AC-11 SESSION LOCK
Control: The information system:
Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after not to exceed fifteen (15)
minutes of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and
Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and
authentication procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away
from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary
nature of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined. This is
typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session locks are not an
acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems, for example, if organizations require users to
log out at the end of workdays. Related control: AC-7.
Session locks (aka screen locks) shall be configured to require authentication for reentry into
the system. Systems supporting token-based authentication shall lock when the token is
removed. All users are required to logout of all systems at the end of each workday and for
any extended absence (6 hours). Operational considerations may require exceptions to this
requirement, e.g., operational testing of weapons systems or watch standing environments.
Unattended Processing
Unattended processing is defined as automated processes executed/running on a user’s behalf
while no users are physically present in the area/facility. Unattended processes generally run
after hours during the week or on weekends. Automated processes may include IT
administrative functions (e.g., backups, scans) as well as mission-related tasks requiring
additional network resources, e.g., executing complex algorithms. Open storage is approved
by the PSO based on physical accreditation with regard to media, mission need, and risk.
Unattended processing is approved by the AO based on system, mission justification, and
environment. Unattended processing must be captured in the SSP/SCTM identifying the
specific IT administrative functions and/or mission-related tasks that run as unattended
processes. If possible, implement screen lock or appropriate prominently displayed signage.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SESSION LOCK | PATTERN-HIDING DISPLAYS
The information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly
viewable image.
Supplemental Guidance: Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, for example,
patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a
blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey sensitive information.
Ensure an unclassified image is displayed on the monitor to prevent unauthorized
disclosure of classified information.

AC-12 SESSION TERMINATION
Control: The information system automatically terminates a user session after [Assignment: organization-
defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect].
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-64
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to
SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections that are associated with communications
sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated
whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such
user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.
Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user’s logical session except those processes
that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.
Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example,
organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day
restrictions on information system use. Related controls: SC-10, SC-23.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SESSION TERMINATION | USER-INITIATED LOGOUTS / MESSAGE DISPLAYS
The information system:
(a) Provides a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions whenever authentication is used to gain
access to all information resources and
(b) Displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable termination of authenticated communications
sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: Information resources to which users gain access via authentication includes,
for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites/web-based services.
Logout messages for web page access, for example, can be displayed after authenticated sessions have
been terminated. However, for some types of interactive sessions including, for example, file transfer
protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically send logout messages as final messages prior to
terminating sessions.

AC-13 SUPERVISION AND REVIEW — ACCESS CONTROL
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2 and AU-6].
AC-14 a. b. PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION
Control: The organization:
Identifies that no user actions can be performed on the information system without identification or
authentication consistent with organizational missions/business functions; and
Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the information system, user
actions not requiring identification or authentication.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no
identification or authentication is required in organizational information systems. Organizations may allow
a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for example, when
individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems, when
individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify
actions that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g.,
emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur,
for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and
is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where
identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where
identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user
actions that can be performed on organizational information systems without identification and
authentication and thus, the values for assignment statements can be none. Related controls: CP-2, IA-2.

a. b. c. d. AC-16 SECURITY ATTRIBUTES
Control: The organization:
Provides the means to associate [Assignment: organization-defined types of security attributes] having
[Assignment: organization-defined security attribute values] with information in storage, in process,
and/or in transmission;
Ensures that the security attribute associations are made and retained with the information;
Establishes the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] for [Assignment:
organization-defined information systems]; and
Determines the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined values or ranges] for each of the
established security attributes.
Supplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using abstractions
known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and
passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or
processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated
with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports.
Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics
of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated
with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause
information to flow among objects, or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be
associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of
security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the
attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the
enforcement of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through
organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of
security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.
Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support
missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given
security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not
releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can
ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the
association of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within
organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information
security policies. Security labels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e.,
encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in
accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of
security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based
enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-
based attribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements
including information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, for
example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects. An example
of a value for both of these attribute types is Top Secret. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-21, AU-
2, AU-10, SC-16, MP-3.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-66
For example, the organization:
a. Provides the means to associate [Classification level; accesses; and handling caveat]
having [Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret; Apples, Oranges; HVSACO,
FOUO, NOFORN, etc.] with information in storage, in process, and/or in transmission;
b. Ensures that the security attribute associations are made and retained with the information;
c. Establishes the permitted [Classification level; accesses; and handling caveat] for [e.g.,
Apples Network, FMDR LAN]; and
d. Determines the permitted [e.g., user cannot select Apples if user selected Unclassified]
for each of the established security attributes.
For bullets (c) and (d) above, reference DoDM 5200.01 Volume 3, DoD Information Security
Program: Protection of Classified Information, Enclosure 7, Section 17.
Example implementation for a system where all users are formally accessed to all
information: a) attributes (clearance, access, PII, etc.) are identified in the headers/footers,
paragraph markings, or in the filename; b) files are saved with these attributes; c) and d) see
organization-defined values in example (c and d) above.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION
The information system dynamically associates security attributes with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects
and objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security policies] as information is created and
combined.
Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic association of security attributes is appropriate whenever the security
characteristics of information changes over time. Security attributes may change, for example, due to
information aggregation issues (i.e., the security characteristics of individual information elements are
different from the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges),
and changes in the security category of information. Related control: AC-4.
SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE VALUE CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
The information system provides authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) the capability to
define or change the value of associated security attributes.
Supplemental Guidance: The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the
ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for information
systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to authorized individuals.
Related controls: AC-6, AU-2.
SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATIONS BY INFORMATION SYSTEM
The information system maintains the association and integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined security
attributes] to [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects].
Supplemental Guidance: Maintaining the association and integrity of security attributes to subjects and
objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations can be used as the basis
of automated policy actions. Automated policy actions include, for example, access control decisions
or information flow control decisions.
SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION OF ATTRIBUTES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
The information system supports the association of [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] with
[Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of
individuals).
Supplemental Guidance: The support provided by information systems can vary to include: (i) prompting
users to select specific security attributes to be associated with specific information objects; (ii)
employing automated mechanisms for categorizing information with appropriate attributes based on
defined policies; or (iii) ensuring that the combination of selected security attributes selected is valid.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-67
(5) (6) Organizations consider the creation, deletion, or modification of security attributes when defining
auditable events.
SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE DISPLAYS FOR OUTPUT DEVICES
The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits
to output devices to identify [Assignment: organization-identified special dissemination, handling, or distribution
instructions] using [Assignment: organization-identified human-readable, standard naming conventions].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or equivalent.
Information system output devices include, for example, printers and video displays on computer
workstations, notebook computers, and personal digital assistants.
SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION BY ORGANIZATION
The organization allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association of [Assignment: organization-defined
security attributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] in accordance with [Assignment:
organization-defined security policies].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires individual users (as opposed to the
information system) to maintain associations of security attributes with subjects and objects.
For example, The organization allows the user to select and manage the appropriate
classification, access, handling caveats for files (e.g., document, email, image, folder)
they create in accordance with SCG or locally defined security policies.
(7) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | CONSISTENT ATTRIBUTE INTERPRETATION
The organization provides a consistent interpretation of security attributes transmitted between distributed
information system components.
Supplemental Guidance: In order to enforce security policies across multiple components in distributed
information systems (e.g., distributed database management systems, cloud-based systems, and
service-oriented architectures), organizations provide a consistent interpretation of security attributes
that are used in access enforcement and flow enforcement decisions. Organizations establish
agreements and processes to ensure that all distributed information system components implement
security attributes with consistent interpretations in automated access/flow enforcement actions.
(8) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUES / TECHNOLOGIES
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or technologies] with [Assignment:
organization-defined level of assurance] in associating security attributes to information.
Supplemental Guidance: The association (i.e., binding) of security attributes to information within
information systems is of significant importance with regard to conducting automated access
enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such security attributes can be
accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different levels of assurance. For example,
information systems can cryptographically bind security attributes to information using digital
signatures with the supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as
hardware roots of trust).
(9) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE REASSIGNMENT
The organization ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only via re-grading
mechanisms validated using [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or procedures].
Supplemental Guidance: Validated re-grading mechanisms are employed by organizations to provide the
requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment activities. The validation is facilitated
by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms are single purpose and of limited function. Since security
attribute reassignments can affect security policy enforcement actions (e.g., access/flow enforcement
decisions), using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is necessary to ensure that such mechanisms
perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.
(10) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE CONFIGURATION BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
The information system provides authorized individuals the capability to define or change the type and value of
security attributes available for association with subjects and objects.
Supplemental Guidance: The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the
ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for information
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-68
systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to authorized individuals
only.

a. b. AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS
Control: The organization:
Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and
implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and
Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.
Supplemental Guidance: Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or
processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote
access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ
encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote
connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs,
when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption
techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization
that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external
networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs
with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network
communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than
public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to
allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use
interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not
required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3. Related
controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CA-7, CM-8, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4, PE-17, PL-4,
SC-10, SI-4.
In most cases within the SAP Community, access to an extension of an information system at
an external location is not considered remote access. For the purpose of this control,
system/network administration within the authorization boundary of the system, regardless of
physical location, is not considered remote access.
Control Enhancements:
(1) REMOTE ACCESS | AUTOMATED MONITORING / CONTROL
The information system monitors and controls remote access methods.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows
organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies
by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of information system components (e.g.,
servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets). Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.
Additional related control: SI-4.
(2) (3) REMOTE ACCESS | PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY / INTEGRITY USING ENCRYPTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote
access sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security
categorization of the information. Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.
REMOTE ACCESS | MANAGED ACCESS CONTROL POINTS
The information system routes all remote accesses through [Assignment: organization-defined number] managed
network access control points.
Supplemental Guidance: Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the
attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC)
initiative requirements for external network connections. Related control: SC-7.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-69
(4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) REMOTE ACCESS | PRIVILEGED COMMANDS / ACCESS
The organization:

only for [Assignment: organization-defined needs]; and
b. Documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.

REMOTE ACCESS | ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR SECURITY FUNCTION ACCESS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-3 (10)].
REMOTE ACCESS | DISABLE NONSECURE NETWORK PROTOCOLS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7].
REMOTE ACCESS | DISCONNECT / DISABLE ACCESS
The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information
system within 30 minutes of identification of an event or inactivity for low confidentiality or integrity impact;
20 minutes for moderate confidentiality or integrity impact; or 10 minutes for high confidentiality or integrity
impact.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires organizations to have the capability to
rapidly disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system and/or disable further
remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality of
missions/business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access to
organizational information systems.
Termination of the session or connection shall be verified.

a. AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS
Control: The organization:
Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance
for wireless access; and
Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.
Supplemental Guidance: Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF),
802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which
provide credential protection and mutual authentication. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19,
CA-3, CA-7, CM-8, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, PL-4, SI-4.
b. If no wireless is authorized in the facility, this control still applies. For example: wireless is
prohibited and implementation guidance should include that users are instructed/reminded
during initial and annual refresher training that wireless access and wireless devices are
prohibited [AC-18.a].
In certain situations, wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines and control of
organization-controlled facilities. As a result, wireless technologies are generally prohibited
from use in SAP facilities. Exceptions may include wireless devices without memory that
convey no meaningful data (e.g., personal wearable devices, remote control devices for
audio/visual presentations and IR and Bluetooth mice). Any exceptions shall be documented
and approved by the AO and cognizant PSO [AC-18.b] to include limiting wireless
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-70
capabilities within the facility boundary. Such exceptions could also warrant Certified
TEMPEST Technical Authority (CTTA) evaluation. CTTA involvement will be at the
discretion of the AO.
The risks associated with personally-owned wireless technologies used in medical devices
must also be assessed. The ISSM/ISSO will work in concert with the PSO/GSSO/CPSO, as
appropriate, to allow necessary medical devices to the greatest extent possible, yet within the
acceptable risk envelope as determined by the AO in coordination with the Information
System Owner. Legal Counsel must be contacted prior to non-approval of any medical
device. See organizational/component PED policy for additional detail.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) WIRELESS ACCESS | AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION
The information system protects wireless access to the system using authentication of both users and devices as
appropriate; e.g., devices to wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi) and users to enterprise services and encryption.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: SC-8, SC-13.
WIRELESS ACCESS | MONITORING UNAUTHORIZED CONNECTIONS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].
WIRELESS ACCESS | DISABLE WIRELESS NETWORKING
The organization disables, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities internally embedded within
information system components prior to issuance and deployment.
Document and ensure wireless is disabled or removed from devices entering the facility,
e.g., televisions, portable electronic devices, printers.
(4) (5) Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-19.
WIRELESS ACCESS | RESTRICT CONFIGURATIONS BY USERS
The organization identifies and explicitly authorizes users allowed to independently configure wireless networking
capabilities.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless
networking capability are enforced in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms employed within
organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-3, SC-15.
WIRELESS ACCESS | ANTENNAS / TRANSMISSION POWER LEVELS
The organization selects radio antennas and calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the probability that
usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.
Supplemental Guidance: Actions that may be taken by organizations to limit unauthorized use of
wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include, for example: (i)
reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit a signal
that can be used by adversaries outside of the physical perimeters of organizations; (ii) employing
measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations; and (iii) using directional/beam forming
antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to
taking such actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio
frequency profile of organizational information systems as well as other systems that may be operating
in the area. Related control: PE-19.

AC-19 b. ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES
Control: The organization:
Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and
implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices; and
Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.
a. Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-71
Supplemental Guidance: A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it
can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g.,
wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage;
and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication
capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for
synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets.
Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity
to the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of
the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to
or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due
to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational
restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific
implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device
identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code
detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for
critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident
software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are
cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in
this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security
controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of
security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the
requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses
mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. Related controls: AC-3, AC-7, AC-18, AC-20, CA-9,
CM-2, IA-2, IA-3, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, PL-4, SC-7, SC-43, SI-3, SI-4.
Mobile devices include portable computing and communications devices with information
storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones,
digital cameras, and audio recording devices, also referred to as PEDs. A PED is any easily
transportable, personally-owned or government/contractor-issued, electronic device that has
the capability to record, copy, store, and/or transmit data, digital images, video, and/or audio.
Examples of a PED include, but are not limited to, pagers, laptop computers, cellular
telephones, radios (amplitude modulation (AM)/frequency modulation (FM), satellite),
compact discs players, cassette players and recorders, PDA (e.g., palmtops, BlackBerrys,
iPads), digital audio devices (e.g., MP3 players, iPods), cameras, camcorders, calculators,
electronic book readers (e.g., Kindles, Nooks, Neos), digital picture frames, and electronic
watches with input capability and/or reminder recorders. See also [MP-4] and [MP-5]
Policy and procedures related to PEDs are detailed in DoDM 5205.07-V3, Enclosure 3,
Section 11, to include a list of authorized PEDs, requirement for PSO and AO (or designee)
approval, as required, prior to introduction into a SAPF, and guidance for control of PEDs.
See the Media Protection (MP) section, for policy and procedures related to removable
storage media.
Reference the MP section for media control including PED removable media.
Purchase of government PEDs shall conform to the same policies and procedures as all other
IT equipment. See the System and Services Acquisition (SA) section for additional
information on mobile devices.
PEDs for Classified Use
PEDs authorized for classified use represent a special class of government-owned mobile
devices authorized with mission justification for its use. The PSO assigns responsibilities for
the use of these PEDs with SAP information - and establishes procedures to control their use
and accountability to ensure SAP information is protected from unauthorized disclosure.

ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES | FULL DEVICE / CONTAINER-BASED ENCRYPTION
The organization employs [Selection: full-device encryption; container encryption] to protect the confidentiality and
integrity of information on all mobile devices.
Supplemental Guidance: Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the
encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including for example, encrypting selected data
structures such as files, records, or fields. Related controls: MP-5, SC-13, SC-28.

AC-20 a. b. USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships
established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems,
allowing authorized individuals to:
Access the information system from external information systems; and
Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of information
systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which
organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security
controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example: (i)
personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal
digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or
public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii)
information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-73
information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of
organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing,
storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services
(e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational
information systems.
For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies,
including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established
between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and
conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external.
These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or
explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such
trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized
individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized
access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose
rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized
individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships
between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on
contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.
This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to
organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov).
Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with
organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of
applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems;
and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external
information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be
established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external
systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.
An external information system may be a standalone or an interconnected system/service.
Providers of external information systems should provide the PSO/ISSM with an external
information system memorandum of understanding (MOU) (e.g., no exchange of resources),
or memorandum of agreement (e.g., exchange of resources such as personnel, services,
funds), as well as SOP and ATO or approval letter. An external information system
MOU/MOA includes information such as the ATO date if applicable, technical concerns
(e.g., wireless (Bluetooth, etc.), cameras are turned off, microphones are disabled), resources
required (e.g., personnel), and additional system information as required (e.g., classified vs.
corporate system). Ensure a co-utilization agreement (CUA) is in place for the facility, if
applicable.
In those cases where the external system connects to the SAP system, ensure an approved
connection agreement is in place with the organization hosting the external information
system. This may be accomplished via the establishment of an approved ISA or MOA. [AC-
20(1)(a)]
For SAP Support Systems (e.g., card readers, alarm systems) reference PE-2 guidance.
Prior to allowing corporate unclassified systems in the SAPF, the CPSO and ISSM/ISSO in
coordination with corporate IT ensures endpoint security is appropriately
hardened/configured, e.g., wireless and microphones are disabled prior to the PSO approving
entry to the SAPF.
Control Enhancements:
(1) USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE
The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access the information
system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only when the organization:
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-74
(a) (b) (2) (3) (4) Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified in the
organization’s information security policy and security plan; or
Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity
hosting the external information system.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where
individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access
organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external
information systems contain the necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls), so as not to
compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational information systems. Verification that the
required security controls have been implemented can be achieved, for example, by third-party,
independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by
organizations. Related control: CA-2.
USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by
authorized individuals on external information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external
information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such devices or
restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used.
USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS / DEVICES
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of non-organizationally owned information systems, system
components, or devices to process, store, or transmit organizational information.
Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other
organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There are risks
to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit
such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally owned devices is allowed
but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i) requiring the implementation of
organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing such connections; (ii) limiting access to
certain types of information, services, or applications; (iii) using virtualization techniques to limit
processing and storage activities to servers or other system components provisioned by the
organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and conditions for usage. For personally owned devices,
organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with
using such devices in operational environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting
forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.
USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | NETWORK ACCESSIBLE STORAGE DEVICES
The organization prohibits the use of [Assignment: organization-defined network accessible storage devices] in
external information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: Network accessible storage devices in external information systems include, for
example, online storage devices in public, hybrid, or community cloud-based systems.
References: FIPS Publication 199.
a. AC-21 INFORMATION SHARING
Control: The organization:
Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access
authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access restrictions on the information for
[Assignment: organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user discretion is
required]; and
Employs [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes] to assist
users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner (e.g.,
privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary information, personally
identifiable information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments) based
on some formal or administrative determination. Depending on the particular information-sharing
b. Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-75
circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level.
Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program/compartment.
Related control: AC-3.
AC-21 is related to AC-3; additional detail may be provided in AC-21 that addresses
assisting users in meeting AC-16 requirements, e.g., Access Look-up tool.
A sharing partner may be an individual or group on the IS, or external to the IS, e.g., sharing
is being done in a circumstance where the IS cannot enforce appropriate sharing controls,
e.g., VTCs, phone conversations, and fax transmittals. The organization will use a PSO-
approved mechanism to ensure informed security decisions are made, preventing inadvertent
disclosures. For example, the organization provides either a tool (e.g., Access Look-up, Joint
Access Database Environment (JADE)) or appropriate guidance on a manual process (e.g.,
contact PSO, HR) to assist the user in making an informed decision prior to sharing
information.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) INFORMATION SHARING | AUTOMATED DECISION SUPPORT
The information system enforces information-sharing decisions by authorized users based on access authorizations
of sharing partners and access restrictions on information to be shared.
INFORMATION SHARING | INFORMATION SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL
The information system implements information search and retrieval services that enforce [Assignment: organization-
defined information sharing restrictions].
References: None.
a. b. c. AC-22 PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CONTENT
Control: The organization:
Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;
Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic
information;
Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information
system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and
Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information at least
quarterly or as new information is posted and removes such information, if discovered.
Supplemental Guidance: In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g.,
information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This control addresses
information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the general public, typically
without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization information
systems is covered by organizational policy. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AT-2, AT-3, AU-13.
d. From an organizational perspective this is a common control. Typically, this control is
addressed by a Public Affairs Office or similar entity.
Information protected under the Privacy Act and vendor proprietary information are
examples of nonpublic information, as is classified information. The information to be
posted must be reviewed by the appropriate organizational element (e.g., Special Security
Office (SSO), Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO), Legal, Public Affairs) prior to being posted
on the organization’s information system. [AC-22.c] [AC-22.d] Unauthorized information, if
discovered, shall be removed immediately from the publicly accessible information system
and reported to the PSO and information owner. Reference IR-6.
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-76
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
AC-23 DATA MINING PROTECTION
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined data mining prevention and
detection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined data storage objects] to adequately detect and
protect against data mining.
Supplemental Guidance: Data storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and database
fields. Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for example: (i) limiting the types of
responses provided to database queries; (ii) limiting the number/frequency of database queries to increase
the work factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and (iii) notifying organizational
personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. This control focuses on the protection of
organizational information from data mining while such information resides in organizational data stores.
In contrast, AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may have been mined or
otherwise obtained from data stores and is now available as open source information residing on external
sites, for example, through social networking or social media websites.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
AC-24 ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS
Control: The organization establishes procedures to ensure [Assignment: organization-defined access
control decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.
Supplemental Guidance: Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when
authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs when
information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to have access control
decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required and it is not always an
optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed information systems, different
entities may perform access control decisions and access enforcement.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION
The information system transmits [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization information] using
[Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: organization-defined information systems]
that enforce access control decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access control
decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization information is
transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To
support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization
information, supporting security attributes. This is due to the fact that in distributed information
systems, there are various access control decisions that need to be made and different entities (e.g.,
services) make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring some security attributes to make the
decisions. Protecting access authorization information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that such
information cannot be altered, spoofed, or otherwise compromised during transmission.
ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY
The information system enforces access control decisions based on [Assignment: organization-defined security
attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf of the user.
Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be made
without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are generally
instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other situations, user
identification information is simply not needed for access control decisions and, especially in the case
Chapter 3-AC PAGE 3-77
of distributed information systems, transmitting such information with the needed degree of assurance
may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish.
References: None.
AC-25 REFERENCE MONITOR
Control: The information system implements a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-defined
access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and
testing, the completeness of which can be assured.
Supplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using abstractions
known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and
passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or
processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated
with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports.
Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory access control policies—a type of access control that
restricts access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The
access controls are mandatory because subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are
restricted from passing those privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectly—that is, the
information system strictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the
policy. The tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the
functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the
mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the
completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent
flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy. Related controls: AC-3, AC-16, SC-3,
SC-39.

FAMILY: AWARENESS AND TRAINING
AT-1 a. 2. b. SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
1. A security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security awareness and training policy and
associated security awareness and training controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Security awareness and training policy at least annually; and
Security awareness and training procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AT family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to security awareness and training are
defined in the remainder of this section.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-12, 800-16, 800-50, 800-100.
a. b. AT-2 SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING
Control: The organization provides basic security awareness training to information system users (including
managers, senior executives, and contractors):
As part of initial training for new users;
When required by information system changes; and
c. At least annually thereafter.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the appropriate content of security awareness training and
security awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the information
systems to which personnel have authorized access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need
for information security and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security
incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for operations security. Security awareness
techniques can include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security
reminders, generating email advisories/notices from senior organizational officials, displaying logon screen
messages, and conducting information security awareness events. Related controls: AT-3, AT-4, PL-4.
The purpose of security awareness training is to sensitize the user to the threats and
vulnerabilities of national security information systems, and inform the user of the need to
protect information and the systems that process, transmit and/or store information. Security
awareness training will be conducted:
• During in-processing. Site specific information will be briefed based on the mission
Chapter 3-AT PAGE 3-79
and requirements of the job.
• Upon receipt of a USERID and authenticator. The Privileged User, ISSO or their
alternate will brief the user on his/her IA responsibilities.
• Annually, as part of refresher training and awareness. Classroom training, briefings,
computer-based training, or seminars will be conducted and participation/completion
documented to ensure all users understand and comply with IA training
requirements.
• Periodically, refresher training and awareness may also be delivered through staff
meetings, online delivery systems, or similar venues.
• To include lessons learned captured from incident handling and response. See [IR-4].
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) SECURITY AWARENESS | PRACTICAL EXERCISES
The organization includes practical exercises in security awareness training that simulate actual cyber attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: Practical exercises may include, for example, no-notice social engineering
attempts to collect information, gain unauthorized access, or simulate the adverse impact of opening
malicious email attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links. Related
controls: CA-2, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3.
SECURITY AWARENESS | INSIDER THREAT
The organization includes security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider
threat.
Supplemental Guidance: Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include
behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction, attempts to gain access to information not
required for job performance, unexplained access to financial resources, bullying or sexual harassment
of fellow employees, workplace violence, and other serious violations of organizational policies,
procedures, directives, rules, or practices. Security awareness training includes how to communicate
employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through
appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and
procedures. Related controls: PL-4, PM-12, PS-3, PS-6.
References: C.F.R. Part 5 Subpart C (5 C.F.R. 930.301); Executive Order 13587; NIST Special Publication
800-50.
AT-3 ROLE-BASED SECURITY TRAINING
Control: The organization provides role-based security training to personnel with assigned security roles and
responsibilities:
a. Before authorizing access to the information system or performing assigned duties;
b. When required by information system changes; and
c. At least annually thereafter.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the appropriate content of security training based on the
assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific security requirements of organizations
and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide
enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers, acquisition/procurement
officials, information system managers, system/network administrators, personnel conducting configuration
management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation
activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software, adequate
security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based
training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical,
personnel, and technical safeguards and countermeasures. Such training can include for example, policies,
procedures, tools, and artifacts for the organizational security roles defined. Organizations also provide the
Chapter 3-AT PAGE 3-80
training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain
security within the context of organizational information security programs. Role-based security training
also applies to contractors providing services to federal agencies. Related controls: AT-2, AT-4, PL-4, PS-
7, SA-3, SA-12, SA-16.
All users shall receive initial and at least annual General user training; while users assigned
to positions requiring privileged access shall receive, in addition, Privileged User training.
General User Training
General user training will include, but is not limited to, the following:
• The organization’s policy for protecting information and IS including the rules of
behavior, which specify acceptable user actions to include explicit restrictions on the
use of social networking sites, posting information on commercial websites, and
sharing information system account information.
• The organization’s policy regarding appropriate use of IS resources as specified in
the User Agreement and the possible repercussions of misuse or abuse.
• How to protect the physical area, media, and equipment (e.g., door access, alarms,
care of hard drives, CDs).
• How to protect authenticators and operate the applicable system security features
(e.g., setting access control rights to files created by the user).
• How to recognize and report suspected security violations and incidents.
• Understanding the importance of classification and control marking compliance.
• Basic actions to take in the event of a data spill. Reference [IR-2].
Privileged User Training
Privileged user training will include, but is not limited to, the following:
• Completion of General user training.
• Rules of behavior, as they apply to the privileged user.
• A thorough understanding of the organization’s policy for protecting information and
systems, to include change management, and the roles and responsibilities of various
organizational units with which they may have to interact.
• The organization’s policy regarding appropriate privileged use of IS resources and
the possible repercussions of misuse or abuse.
• How to protect the system (e.g., maintenance and backup, care of system media,
protection and retention of audit logs, endpoint security).
• How to protect passwords, or other authentication devices/mechanisms, and be
familiar with operating system security features and technical safeguards of the
system.
• How to recognize and report potential security vulnerabilities, threats, security
violations, or incidents.
• Technical actions to take in the event of a data spill. Reference [IR-2].
• How to implement and use specific IA products provided by the organization.
• IA training and certification in compliance with DoD 8570.01-M, or its replacement
manual based on DoDD 8140.01, as required for designated positions.
Prior to obtaining privileged user system access credentials:
Chapter 3-AT PAGE 3-81
• Complete the applicable Privileged User Access Training as required by
agency/service element. See also Security Training [AT-3].
• Read and sign the applicable Service/Agency privileged user agreement for SAP
information systems. The privileged user agreement must include the language in
Attachment 2 the “Policy on Use of Department of Defense (DoD) Information
Systems Standard Consent Banner and User Agreement,” in accordance with DoDI
8500.01, Cybersecurity, which is posted as stated in DoDI 8500.01 on the IASE
Website (http://iase.disa.mil). Where a user will obtain both a general user account
and a privileged user account, two separate user agreements should be used.
• Provide the training completion certificate and privileged user agreement to the
ISSM.
Assured File Transfer (AFT) Training
Also reference [AC-4]
An individual performing data transfers between systems of differing security domains is
commonly referred to as a DTA. The DTA is performing a security-relevant function in
providing endpoint security during a data transfer and is therefore, by definition, a privileged
user. However, the DTA role is not specifically called out in 8570.01-M and therefore does
not required an ‘8570’ certification unless the AO directs otherwise.
DTAs must be identified in writing. AFT training for DTAs will include, but is not limited
to the following:
• Training in the use of data review and sanitization tools (automated and manual).
• Working knowledge of the Program Security Guide and Classification Marking
Guide.
• File formats permissible for trusted downloading.
• Authorized media formats and marking requirements.
• Program management approval and Security process compliance review.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) SECURITY TRAINING | ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS
The organization provides [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with initial and at least annually or
when sufficient changes are made to environmental control systems training in the employment and operation
of environmental controls.
Supplemental Guidance: Environmental controls include, for example, fire suppression and detection
devices/systems, sprinkler systems, handheld fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, smoke detectors,
temperature/humidity, HVAC, and power within the facility. Organizations identify personnel with
specific roles and responsibilities associated with environmental controls requiring specialized
training. Related controls: PE-1, PE-13, PE-14, PE-15.
SECURITY TRAINING | PHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS
The organization provides [Assignment: : organization-defined personnel or roles] with initial and at least annually
or when sufficient changes are made to physical security systems training in the employment and operation of
physical security controls.
Supplemental Guidance: Physical security controls include, for example, physical access control devices,
physical intrusion alarms, monitoring/surveillance equipment, and security guards (deployment and
operating procedures). Organizations identify personnel with specific roles and responsibilities
associated with physical security controls requiring specialized training. Related controls: PE-2, PE-3,
PE-4, PE-5.
SECURITY TRAINING | PRACTICAL EXERCISES
The organization includes practical exercises in security training that reinforce training objectives.
Chapter 3-AT PAGE 3-82
(4) Supplemental Guidance: Practical exercises may include, for example, security training for software
developers that includes simulated cyber attacks exploiting common software vulnerabilities (e.g.,
buffer overflows), or spear/whale phishing attacks targeted at senior leaders/executives. These types of
practical exercises help developers better understand the effects of such vulnerabilities and appreciate
the need for security coding standards and processes.
SECURITY TRAINING | SUSPICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
The organization provides training to its personnel on [Assignment: organization-defined indicators of malicious
code] to recognize suspicious communications and anomalous behavior in organizational information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard that can be
employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against malicious code coming
in to organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel are trained to look for indications of
potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange
or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known
sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious email or web
communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking on embedded web links, and checking the
source of email addresses). For this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained
and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to
recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially provide early
warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by organizational
personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection tools and systems
employed by organizations.

Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. An audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the audit and accountability policy and associated
audit and accountability controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Audit and accountability policy at least annually; and
Audit and accountability procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AU family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to audit and accountability are defined in
the remainder of this section.
An audit trail is a record of events. Audit trails may be limited to specific events, or they
may encompass all activities on a system. A computer system might have several audit
trails, each focused on a particular type of activity, such as detecting security violations,
performance problems, and design and programming flaws in applications. Periodic reviews
of audit logs may be useful for:
• Detecting unauthorized access to information
• Establishing a culture of responsibility and accountability
• Reducing the risk associated with inappropriate accesses (behavior may be altered
when individuals know they are being monitored)
• Providing forensic evidence during investigations of suspected and known security
incidents and breaches to privacy, especially if sanctions against a workforce
member, business associate, or other contracted agent will be applied
• Tracking disclosures of sensitive and/or classified information
• Responding to concerns regarding unauthorized access
• Evaluating the overall effectiveness of policy and user education regarding
appropriate access and use of information (comparing actual activity to expected
activity and discovering where additional training or education may be necessary to
reduce errors)
• Detecting new threats and intrusion attempts
• Identifying potential problems
• Addressing compliance with regulatory requirements
An audit trail enables a security practitioner to trace the history of activities on an
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-84
information system. The audit trail provides information about additions, deletions, or
modifications to data within a system. Audit trails enable the enforcement of individual
accountability by allowing a reconstruction of events. Like monitoring, one purpose of an
audit trail is to assist in problem identification and resolution. Any unusual activity or
variation from the established procedures should be identified and investigated. Audit can
assist in:
• Accountability – Log data can identify what accounts are associated with certain
events. This information then can be used to highlight where training and/or
disciplinary actions are needed. Accountability is the system’s capability to
determine the actions and behaviors of a single individual within a system and to
identify that particular individual. Audit trails and logs support accountability.
• Reconstruction – Log data can be reviewed chronologically to determine what was
happening both before and during an event. For this to happen, the accuracy and
coordination of system clocks are critical. To accurately trace activity, clocks need
to be regularly synchronized to a central source to ensure that the date/time stamps
are in synch.
• Intrusion Detection – Unusual or unauthorized events can be detected through the
review of log data, assuming that the correct data is being logged and reviewed. The
definition of what constitutes unusual activity varies, but can include failed login
attempts, login attempts outside of designated schedules, locked accounts, port
sweeps, network activity levels, memory utilization, key file/data access, etc.
• Problem Detection – In the same way that log data can be used to identify security
events, it can be used to identify problems that need to be addressed. For example,
investigating causal factors of failed jobs, resource utilization, trending and so on.
The audit capability should be automated, and provide adequate on-line or off-line storage of
audit information separate from data files. If automated audit collection is not supported, use
of manual audits must be documented in the SSP. The AO’s approval to operate must
specify approval to implement manual audits.
Control Enhancements: None.

Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related
information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;
Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact
investigations of security incidents; and
Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: same as ‘a’
above, during all periods of system operation.
Supplemental Guidance: An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system.
Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of
information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and
ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed
accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party
credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate
for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other
information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are
audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must
have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability
except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing
requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and
control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at
various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting
the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the
identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the
auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g.,
processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented
architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4, SI-4.
c. d. Determine, based on current threat information and on-going assessment of risk, which
events are to be audited within the information system.
Ensure system console activities are audited as well as access to pertinent objects other than
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-86
security-relevant, e.g., mission, program.
Be aware that [AU-2.a] bullet 13, Application, may generate more audits than deemed
necessary. Tailoring audit collection requirements related to specific applications is
recommended.

AUDIT EVENTS | REVIEWS AND UPDATES
The organization reviews and updates the audited events at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: Over time, the events that organizations believe should be audited may change.
Reviewing and updating the set of audited events periodically is necessary to ensure that the current set
is still necessary and sufficient.
The review shall include coordination with other organizational entities requiring audit-
related information (e.g., Incident Response, Counterintelligence) to enhance mutual
support and to help guide the selection of auditable events.

AU-3 CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS
Control: The information system generates audit records containing information that establishes what type
of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome
of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the event.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control,
includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event
descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.
Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the
security state of the information system after the event occurred). Related controls: AU-2, AU-8, AU-12,
SI-11.
Specifically, audit records shall contain, at a minimum, the following content:
• USERID
• Type of event/action
• Success or failure of event/action
• Date
• Time
• Terminal or workstation ID
• Entity that initiated event/action
• Entity that completed event/action
• Remote Access
If manual audit collection is approved by the AO, the audit records shall contain, at a
minimum, the following content:
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-87
• Date
• Identification of the user
• Time the user logs on and off the system
• Function(s) performed
• Terminal or Workstation ID
Manual audit logs may be used to record the transmission of any data over a fax connected to
a secure voice line (e.g., Secure Terminal Equipment (STE)). Reference DoDM 5205.07-V1,
Enclosure 5, para 2.b. These logs will be maintained for one year and must include the
following information:
• Sender’s name, organization and telephone number
• Date and time of fax transmission
• Classification level of the information
• Recipient’s name, organization and telephone number
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION
The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information: [Assignment:
organization-defined additional, more detailed information].
Supplemental Guidance: Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes,
for example, full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account
users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to only that information
explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs
by not including information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to
locate information of interest.
CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF PLANNED AUDIT RECORD CONTENT
The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in audit
records generated by [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in audit
records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations coordinate the
selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and configuration capability
provided by the information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7.
References: None.
AU-4 AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY
Control: The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with community best
practice and configures auditing to reduce the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit
processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit storage capacity
reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of
auditing capability. Related controls: AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-11, SI-4.
Proper audit storage capacity is crucial to ensuring the ongoing logging of critical events.
The information system must be configured to allocate sufficient log record storage capacity
so that it will not become exhausted. See also AU-5(1).
Control Enhancements:
(1) AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY | TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE
The information system off-loads audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a different system
or media than the system being audited.
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-88
Supplemental Guidance: Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of
audit records by moving the records from the primary information system to a secondary or alternate
system. It is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity; the audit
storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the secondary or
alternate system designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred.
Organizations should assign a frequency or threshold capacity when audit records are
off-loaded. Related control: AU-9(2)
References: None.
AU-5 a. b. RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES
Control: The information system:
Alerts [[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] ] in the event of an audit processing
failure; and
Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be taken (e.g.,
shut down information system, overwrite oldest audit records, stop generating audit records)].
Supplemental Guidance: Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors, failures in
the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Organizations may
choose to define additional actions for different audit processing failures (e.g., by type, by location, by
severity, or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e.,
distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the total audit storage capacity of
organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both. Related controls: AU-4, SI-12.
At a minimum, record any audit processing failure in the audit log.
System should alert a system administrator and/or ISSM/ISSO.
For IS that are not capable of providing a warning, procedures for a manual method must be
documented.
Tactical/deployable information systems may be developed without all the features and
security controls of standard information systems. Audit requirements for these systems
should be reviewed for mission impact. For example, failure of the audit process should not
interfere with continued normal operation of a mission critical system.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY
The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations]
within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when allocated audit record storage volume reaches
maximum of 75 percent maximum audit record storage capacity of repository maximum audit record storage
capacity.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories distributed
across multiple information system components, with each repository having different storage volume
capacities.
RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | REAL-TIME ALERTS
The information system provides an alert in [Assignment: organization-defined real-time period] to [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations] when the following audit failure events occur: minimally but
not limited to: auditing software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit
storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
Supplemental Guidance: Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide
these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in
seconds or less).
RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | CONFIGURABLE TRAFFIC VOLUME THRESHOLDS
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-89
(4) The information system enforces configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds reflecting limits on
auditing capacity and [Selection: rejects; delays] network traffic above those thresholds.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of network
communications traffic if auditing such traffic is determined to exceed the storage capacity of the
information system audit function. The rejection or delay response is triggered by the established
organizational traffic volume thresholds which can be adjusted based on changes to audit storage
capacity.
RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | SHUTDOWN ON FAILURE
The information system invokes a [Selection: full system shutdown; partial system shutdown; degraded operational
mode with limited mission/business functionality available] in the event of [Assignment: organization-defined audit
failures], unless an alternate audit capability exists.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger automatic
information system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance of ensuring
mission/business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of the audit failure is not so
severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the information system supporting the core
organizational missions/business operations. In those instances, partial information system shutdowns
or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may be viable alternatives. Related control:
AU-15.
References: None.
AU-6 a. b. AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING
Control: The organization:
Reviews and analyzes information system audit records at least weekly for indications of any
inappropriate or unusual activity; and
Reports findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related auditing
performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results from monitoring of account usage,
remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system component
inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature and humidity,
equipment delivery and removal, communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile
code, and use of VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include, for example,
incident response team, help desk, information security group/department. If organizations are prohibited
from reviewing and analyzing audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain
national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations
granted such authority. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-17, AT-3, AU-7, AU-16, CA-7, CM-5,
CM-10, CM-11, IA-3, IA-5, IR-5, IR-6, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PE-6, PE-14, PE-16, RA-5, SC-7, SC-18, SC-
19, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.
The purpose of this review is to verify all pertinent activity is properly recorded and
appropriate action has been taken to correct and report any identified problems. These
reviews shall be documented in either an electronic or manual log. Organizationally defined
personnel or roles may include ISO, ISSM and/or PSO.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PROCESS INTEGRATION
The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit review, analysis, and reporting processes to
support organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious activities.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational processes benefiting from integrated audit review, analysis, and
reporting include, for example, incident response, continuous monitoring, contingency planning, and
Inspector General audits. Related controls: AU-12, PM-7.

(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATE AUDIT REPOSITORIES
The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide
situational awareness.
Supplemental Guidance: Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three
tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and information system) and
supports cross-organization awareness. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4.
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CENTRAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS
The information system provides the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from multiple
components within the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, for
example, Security Information Management products. Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | INTEGRATION / SCANNING AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES
The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of [Selection (one or more): vulnerability scanning
information; performance data; information system monitoring information; [Assignment: organization-defined
data/information collected from other sources]] to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual
activity.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the
generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the enhancement requires
that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis
of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System tools can facilitate audit
record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system components as well as audit record
correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by
organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches
for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with
vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and
correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help
uncover denial of service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources.
Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating
audit information to operational situations. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4, RA-5.
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING
The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access
to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.
Supplemental Guidance: The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from information
systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior or supporting
evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s identity for logical access to
certain information systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was
actually present at the facility when the logical access occurred, may prove to be useful in
investigations.
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PERMITTED ACTIONS
The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [Selection (one or more): information system process; role;
user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit information.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations specify permitted actions for information system processes, roles,
and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records through account
management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit information is a way to enforce the
principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced by the information system and include, for
example, read, write, execute, append, and delete.
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED COMMANDS
The organization performs a full text analysis of audited privileged commands in a physically distinct component or
subsystem of the information system, or other information system that is dedicated to that analysis.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the dedicated
analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such information on the
information system where the users have elevated privileges including the capability to execute
privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers the full text of privileged
commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to analysis that considers only the name of
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-91
the command. Full text analysis includes, for example, the use of pattern matching and heuristics.
Related controls: AU-3, AU-9, AU-11, AU-12.
(9) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES
The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to enhance organization-
wide situational awareness.
Supplemental Guidance: Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records
documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use of
organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more directed
analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the
information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to such information to
minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals that do
not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit
information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being involved in a security
incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to initiating such actions. Related control: AT-2.
(10) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | AUDIT LEVEL ADJUSTMENT
The organization adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting within the information system when there is
a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of
information.
Supplemental Guidance: The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit review, analysis, and reporting
may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new information received.
References: None.
AU-7 a. b. AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION
Control: The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation capability that:
Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact
investigations of security incidents; and
Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and
organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit reduction and
report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information system or from the same
organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction capability can include, for example,
modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records.
The report generation capability provided by the information system can generate customizable reports.
Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is
insufficient. Related control: AU-6.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION | AUTOMATIC PROCESSING
The information system provides the capability to process audit records for events of interest based on [Assignment:
organization-defined audit fields within audit records].
Supplemental Guidance: Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit record fields
including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event locations, event times, event dates,
system resources involved, IP addresses involved, or information objects accessed. Organizations may
define audit event criteria to any degree of granularity required, for example, locations selectable by
general networking location (e.g., by network or subnetwork) or selectable by specific information
system component. Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.
AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION | AUTOMATIC SORT AND SEARCH
The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit records for events of interest based on the
content of [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit records].
Supplemental Guidance: Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents of audit
record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers; (iii) Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of event; or (v) event success/failure.
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-92
References: None.
a. b. AU-8 TIME STAMPS
Control: The information system:
Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and
Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets organization-defined granularity of time measurement of
a minimum of one (1) minute.
Supplemental Guidance: Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is
commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree
of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define
different time granularities for different system components. Time service can also be critical to other
security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of
the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. Related controls: AU-3, AU-12.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) TIME STAMPS | SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE
The information system:
(a) Compares the internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with an organization-defined
authoritative time source e.g., Domain Controller, US Naval Observatory time server; and
(b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater
than the organizationally defined granularity in AU-8.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information
systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
TIME STAMPS | SECONDARY AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE
The information system identifies a secondary authoritative time source that is located in a different geographic
region than the primary authoritative time source.
For example, every 24 hours verify internal information system clocks are in sync
against an internal source, e.g., domain controller, NTP server. Then, once a month sync
up the source clock (e.g., domain controller) with an external source, e.g., USNO.
References: None.
AU-9 PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION
Control: The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized access,
modification, and deletion.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and
audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. This control focuses on technical
protection of audit information. Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection
controls and physical and environmental protection controls. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, MP-2, MP-4,
PE-2, PE-3, PE-6.
Audit information shall be handled and protected at the same security level of the
information system from which it originated until reviewed and a determination is made of
the actual classification.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | HARDWARE WRITE-ONCE MEDIA
The information system writes audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media.
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-93
(2) (3) (4) Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to the initial generation of audit trails (i.e., the
collection of audit records that represents the audit information to be used for detection, analysis, and
reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit trails. The enhancement does not apply to the
initial generation of audit records prior to being written to an audit trail. Write-once, read-many
(WORM) media includes, for example, Compact Disk-Recordable (CD-R) and Digital Video Disk-
Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of switchable write-protection media such as on tape
cartridges or Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives results in write-protected, but not write-once, media.
Related controls: AU-4, AU-5.
PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | AUDIT BACKUP ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS
The information system backs up audit records at least weekly onto a physically different system or system
component than the system or component being audited.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information
system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records. Related controls: AU-4,
AU-5, AU-11.
PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit
tools.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit
information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling
distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of
the secret key used to generate the hash. Related controls: AU-10, SC-12, SC-13.
PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS
The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only [Assignment: organization-defined
subset of privileged users Assignment: organization-defined subset of privileged users].
Supplemental Guidance: Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who are also
the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit
activities or modifying audit records. This control enhancement requires that privileged access be
further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-
related privileges. Related control: AC-5.
Limit access to the audit role. Computer security managers and system administrators or
managers should have access for review purposes; however, security and/or
administration personnel who maintain logical access functions may have no need for
access to audit logs.
The AO may tailor in AU-9(6) to allow read only for a system administrator requiring
access to audits for troubleshooting/diagnostics purposes.
(5) (6) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
The organization enforces dual authorization for [Selection (one or more): movement; deletion] of any security
related audit information.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose different selection options for different types of audit
information. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized individuals in
order to execute. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control. Related controls: AC-3,
MP-2.
PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | READ ONLY ACCESS
The organization authorizes read-only access to audit information to [Assignment: organization-defined subset of
privileged users.
Supplemental Guidance: Restricting privileged user authorizations to read-only helps to limit the
potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users (e.g., deleting audit records to
cover up malicious activity).
References: None.
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-94
AU-10 NON-REPUDIATION
Control: The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an
individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be covered by
non-repudiation].
Supplemental Guidance: Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for example,
creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence
or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by: (i) authors of not
having authored particular documents; (ii) senders of not having transmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not
having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services
can be used to determine if information originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took
specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received
specific information. Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or
mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8, SC-13, SC-
16, SC-17, SC-23.
Non-repudiation services are obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g.,
digital signatures, digital message receipts). Digital signatures, if implemented, shall employ
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-validated or National Security Agency
(NSA)-approved cryptography, as appropriate for the classification of the information
system.
Tactical/deployable information systems may be developed without all the features and
security controls of standard information systems. Non-repudiation requirements for these
systems should be reviewed for mission impact.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) NON-REPUDIATION | ASSOCIATION OF IDENTITIES
The information system:
(a) Binds the identity of the information producer with the information to [Assignment: organization-defined strength
of binding]; and
(b) Provides the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the producer of the information.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement supports audit requirements that provide
organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in the event of
an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of the binding between the
information producer and the information based on the security category of the information and
relevant risk factors. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.
NON-REPUDIATION | VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION PRODUCER IDENTITY
The information system:
(a) Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency]; and
(b) Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between
production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of
cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or
generated automatically. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-16.
NON-REPUDIATION | CHAIN OF CUSTODY
The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established chain of custody
for all information reviewed or released.
Supplemental Guidance: Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence through its
collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person who handled the
evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the transfer. If the
reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from the release/transfer
function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of the information to be
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-95
(4) released with the information and the information label. In the case of human reviews, this control
enhancement provides organizational officials the means to identify who reviewed and released the
information. In the case of automated reviews, this control enhancement ensures that only approved
review functions are employed. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.
NON-REPUDIATION | VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION REVIEWER IDENTITY
The information system:
(a) Validates the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior
to release/transfer between [Assignment: organization-defined security domains]; and
(b) Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between
review and transfer/release. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of
cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine validations are in response to user requests or
generated automatically. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.

AU-11 AUDIT RECORD RETENTION
Control: The organization retains audit records for a minimum of 5 years for SAP data, Sensitive
Compartmented Information and Sources And Methods Intelligence information AND A minimum
of 1 year for all other information (Unclassified through Collateral Top Secret) to provide support for
after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information
retention requirements.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that they are no longer
needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for example, retention
and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoenas, and
law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of audit records relative to such types
of actions and standard response processes for each type of action. The National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules provide federal policy on record retention. Related
controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-9, MP-6.
The purpose of audit retention is to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of
security incidents and to meet regulatory and organization information retention
requirements. Although most requests for audit information from law enforcement (LE) or
inspectors general (IG) are within the one (1) year mark, audit records going back five (5)
years provide historic information that is frequently used in espionage cases for damage
assessment purposes to determine what the (alleged) perpetrator may have accessed.
The AO has the authority to scale back the number of years retained depending upon the
mission supported by the system, e.g., a short-lived research and development (R&D) or
science and technology (S&T) effort, tactical or fleet capability, platform IT (PIT)
designation.
Control Enhancements:
(1) AUDIT RECORD RETENTION | LONG-TERM RETRIEVAL CAPABILITY
The organization employs a retention of technology to access audit records for the duration of the required
retention period to ensure that long-term audit records generated by the information system can be retrieved.
Supplemental Guidance: Measures employed by organizations to help facilitate the retrieval of audit
records include, for example, converting records to newer formats, retaining equipment capable of
reading the records, and retaining necessary documentation to help organizational personnel
understand how to interpret the records.

a. b. AU-12 AUDIT GENERATION
Control: The information system:
Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at all
information systems and network components;
Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select which auditable events are to
be audited by specific components of the information system; and
Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit records can be generated from many different information system
components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. These
events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of generating audit
records. Related controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7.
Control Enhancements:
c. (1) AUDIT GENERATION | SYSTEM-WIDE / TIME-CORRELATED AUDIT TRAIL
The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within the tolerance defined
in AU-8.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records
can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the
records within organizational tolerances. Related controls: AU-8, AU-12.
The AU-12 (1) organization-defined IS components is a subset of the organization-
defined components in AU-12 focused on correlated and centralizing specific audits.
(2) (3) AUDIT GENERATION | STANDARDIZED FORMATS
The information system produces a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit records in a
standardized format.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit information that is normalized to common standards promotes
interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and information systems.
This facilitates production of event information that can be more readily analyzed and correlated.
Standard formats for audit records include, for example, system log records and audit records
compliant with Common Event Expressions (CEE). If logging mechanisms within information systems
do not conform to standardized formats, systems may convert individual audit records into
standardized formats when compiling system-wide audit trails.
AUDIT GENERATION | CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
The information system provides the capability for [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or roles] to change
the auditing to be performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] based on
[Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within [Assignment: organization-defined time
thresholds].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve information system
resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a
specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish
time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near real-time, within minutes, or
within hours. Related control: AU-7.
References: None.
AU-13 MONITORING FOR INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
Control: The organization monitors [Assignment: organization-defined open source information and/or
information sites] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] for evidence of unauthorized disclosure of
organizational information.
Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-97
Supplemental Guidance: Open source information includes, for example, social networking sites. Related
controls: PE-3, SC-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) MONITORING FOR INFORMATION DISCLOSURE | USE OF AUTOMATED TOOLS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to determine if organizational information has been disclosed in
an unauthorized manner.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms can include, for example, automated scripts to monitor
new posts on selected websites, and commercial services providing notifications and alerts to
organizations.
MONITORING FOR INFORMATION DISCLOSURE | REVIEW OF MONITORED SITES
The organization reviews the open source information sites being monitored [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency].
References: None.
AU-14 SESSION AUDIT
Control: The information system provides the capability for authorized users to select a user session to
capture/record or view/hear.
Supplemental Guidance: Session audits include, for example, monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites
visited, and recording information and/or file transfers. Session auditing activities are developed,
integrated, and used in consultation with legal counsel in accordance with applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or standards. Related controls: AC-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-
9, AU-11.
Verify system is capable of performing session audits, but do not initiate without legal
counsel and AO involvement. This control may be used to audit file transfers of DTAs.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) SESSION AUDIT | SYSTEM START-UP
The information system initiates session audits at system start-up.
SESSION AUDIT | CAPTURE/RECORD AND LOG CONTENT
The information system provides the capability for authorized users to capture/record and log content related to a
user session.
SESSION AUDIT | REMOTE VIEWING / LISTENING
The information system provides the capability for authorized users to remotely view/hear all content related to an
established user session in real time.
References: None.
AU-15 ALTERNATE AUDIT CAPABILITY
Control: The organization provides an alternate audit capability in the event of a failure in primary audit
capability that provides [Assignment: organization-defined alternate audit functionality].
Supplemental Guidance: Since an alternate audit capability may be a short-term protection employed until
the failure in the primary auditing capability is corrected, organizations may determine that the alternate
audit capability need only provide a subset of the primary audit functionality that is impacted by the failure.
Related control: AU-5.
Control Enhancements: None.

Chapter 3-AU PAGE 3-98
AU-16 CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit
information is transmitted across organizational boundaries.
Supplemental Guidance: When organizations use information systems and/or services of external
organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations. For
example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across organizational
boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance
ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g., the type of auditing
capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing
requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the requests emanated from
authorized individuals. Related control: AU-6.
This control may be met through use of an ISA, SLA, or MOA.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | IDENTITY PRESERVATION
The organization requires that the identity of individuals be preserved in cross-organizational audit trails.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies when there is a need to be able to trace
actions that are performed across organizational boundaries to a specific individual.
CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION
The organization provides cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment: organization-defined organizations]
based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing agreements].
Supplemental Guidance: Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization
sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being performed.
For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient information to determine
the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information resources by individuals in other
organizations. In some instances, only the home organizations of individuals have the appropriate
knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring the sharing of audit information among
organizations.

FAMILY: SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION
CA-1 2. b. SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. A security assessment and authorization policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security assessment and authorization
policy and associated security assessment and authorization controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
1. Security assessment and authorization policy at least annually; and
2. Security assessment and authorization procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CA family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to security assessment and authorization are
defined in the remainder of this section.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-12, 800-37, 800-53A, 800-100.
a. b. CA-2 SECURITY ASSESSMENTS
Control: The organization:
Develops a security assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including:
1. Security controls and control enhancements under assessment;
2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness; and
3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities;
Assesses the security controls in the information system and its environment of operation at least
annually, or as stipulated in the organization's continuous monitoring program to determine the
extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
desired outcome with respect to meeting established security requirements;
Produces a security assessment report that documents the results of the assessment; and
Provides the results of the security control assessment to SCA at a minimum.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations assess security controls in organizational information systems and the
environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations; (ii)
FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities.
Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into organizational information systems;
(ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide essential
c. d. Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-100
information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure
compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security
controls from Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented
in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of
assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture
of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment
results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and
completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA
requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment
activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security
assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided
to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives.
To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following
sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii)
system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current,
relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of
assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the
results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to
initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during
continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in
accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability
Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by
external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-5,
CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-4.
The initial security assessment, frequently conducted by the SCA, or other AO designee,
determines the extent to which the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
requirements. The AO determines the level of assessor impartiality required, based on the
criticality and sensitivity of the information system, to ensure the assessment results
produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision.
A recurring security assessment is conducted as part of the continuous monitoring
requirements to ensure the IS complies with the documented security requirements and that
the security of the IS, as authorized, is maintained throughout its life cycle. Security
assessments are routinely conducted by SCAs, ISOs, common control providers,
ISSM/ISSOs, independent assessors, auditors, and IGs during the system life cycle to ensure
that security controls are effective and continue to be effective in the operational
environment where the system is deployed. After the initial authorization, the organization
continues to assess the security controls on an ongoing basis. The assessments are based on
the continuous monitoring plan developed by the ISO or CCP and approved by the AO.
Types of assessments include self-assessments as well as independent assessments.
As part of the security assessment process, a Security Assessment Plan must be developed
either by the ISO, ISSM/ISSO, ISSE or the SCA. The Security Assessment Plan provides
the objectives for the security assessment, the proposed method for verifying compliance
with security controls, a proposed schedule for conducting the assessment, and assessment
procedures. For the DoD SAP Community and for all IS under the purview of the SAP AO,
the Security Assessment Plan is embodied in the information provided in the SSP, the
SCTM, and the Security Control Assessment Procedures, all of which must be reviewed and
approved by the SCA.
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-101
The following steps will be considered when developing the Security Assessment Plan:
• Determine which security controls/control enhancements are to be included in the
assessment based upon the contents of the SSP and the purpose/scope of the
assessment and whether this is a complete or partial assessment.
• Select the appropriate assessment procedures to be used during the assessment based
on the security controls and control enhancements that are to be included in the
assessment. Refer to NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls
in Federal Information Systems and Organizations, Building Effective Security
Assessment Plans, Appendix F, for an assessment procedure for each security control
and control enhancement.
• Tailor the selected assessment procedures to meet organizational needs
(e.g., select appropriate assessment methods and objectives).
• Develop additional assessment procedures to address any security requirements or
controls that are not sufficiently covered by NIST SP 800-53A.
o The ISO may develop and implement additional security controls, and
therefore assessments, specific to the organization based on organizational
policies, mission or business function requirements, and the risk assessment.
See the Risk Assessment section for further details regarding assessment of
risk. The assessment procedures developed are subsequently integrated into
the Security Assessment Plan.
• Optimize the assessment procedures to reduce duplication of effort (e.g., sequencing
and consolidating assessment procedures) to provide cost-effective assessment
solutions.
o The assessment of some security controls before others may provide
information that facilitates understanding and assessment of other controls.
At the conclusion of the security assessment activity with a goal of receiving authorization or
reauthorization to operate, a SAR shall be produced by the individual conducting the
assessment, e.g., SCA. The SAR conveys the results of the security assessment to
appropriate organizational officials. The SAR is included in the security authorization
package that is reviewed by the SCA and provided to the AO with the information necessary
to make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to place an information system into
operation or continue its operation. The SAR details any shortcomings and/or vulnerabilities
identified during the security assessment and a POA&M addressing the fixes, workarounds,
etc. is developed.
Security assessment activities and a resulting SAR are also conducted/produced by the
ISO/ISSM/ISSO as part of continuous monitoring and other activities as outlined in the NIST
Supplemental Guidance for this control.
Information revealing specific vulnerabilities (other than the known vulnerabilities of widely
available commercial products) and the compiled results of vulnerability analyses for all SAP
systems shall be classified in accordance with the Program Security Classification Guide
(SCG), usually at a minimum level of SECRET, and requires appropriate protection levels to
control access to the information. When appropriate, the information will be marked Handle
via Special Access Channels Only (HVSACO) to ensure a review by the Initial Denial
Authority is required before the information is considered for release outside of SAP control
channels.
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-102
The information detailed in the SAR and POA&M (reference CA-5) is used by the AO when
making the approval decision.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | INDEPENDENT ASSESSORS
The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with AO determined level of impartiality based on the
risk assessment for the system to conduct security control assessments.
Supplemental Guidance: Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who
conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems. Impartiality implies that
assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to the development,
operation, or management of the organizational information systems under assessment or to the
determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create
a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii)
assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or
(iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.
Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to
public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required
level of independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk
to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine
if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be
used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether contracted security
assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are
not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of assessors
conducting assessments. In special situations, for example, when organizations that own the
information systems are small or organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by
individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of system owners,
independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are
carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness,
accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed
for purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with
sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to
repeat assessments.
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS
The organization includes as part of security control assessments, [Assignment: organization-defined frequency],
[Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection (one or more): in-depth monitoring; vulnerability scanning;
malicious user testing; insider threat assessment; performance/load testing; [Assignment: organization-defined other
forms of security assessment]].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider threat
assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and validation) to
improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating current performance levels
as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations conduct assessment activities in
accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
standards. Authorizing officials approve the assessment methods in coordination with the
organizational risk executive function. Organizations can incorporate vulnerabilities uncovered during
assessments into vulnerability remediation processes. Related controls: PE-3, SI-2.
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS
The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment: organization-defined information system]
performed by [Assignment: organization-defined external organization] when the assessment meets [Assignment:
organization-defined requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by
other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing existing assessment
evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for organizational assessments by
limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The
factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from
external organizations can vary. Determinations for accepting assessment results can be based on, for
example, past assessment experiences one organization has had with another organization, the
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-103
reputation that organizations have with regard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting
assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation,
policies, or directives.

a. b. c. CA-3 SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS
Control: The organization:
Authorizes connections from the information system to other information systems through the use of
Interconnection Security Agreements;
Documents, for each interconnection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the
nature of the information communicated; and
Reviews and updates Interconnection Security Agreements at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems (i.e.,
system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email and
website browsing. Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information
systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both
within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with
information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems have the
same authorizing official, organizations do not need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements.
Instead, organizations can describe the interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in
their respective security plans. If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the
same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the
interface characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations
may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially for
interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private sector) organizations.
Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. For certain technologies
(e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized connections in place
during preoperational testing. Such connections may require Interconnection Security Agreements and be
subject to additional security controls. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-20, AU-2, AU-12, AU-16, CA-7,
IA-3, SA-9, SC-7, SI-4.
Organizations shall identify any connections of an information system to an external
information system in the SSP and ensure connections from the information system to
external information systems are authorized through the use of an ISA. An external
information system is an information system or component that is outside the authorization
boundary as defined in the SSP. (Reference AC-20.)
Organizations typically have no direct control over the security controls or security control
effectiveness for these external systems or components. Organizations shall monitor all
information system connections on an ongoing basis to verify enforcement of the security
requirements. If the interconnecting systems have the same AO, an ISA is not required,
although one may still be beneficial.
When a need arises to connect two different IS operating at different security classification
levels, the connection is referred to as a cross domain connection. Any cross domain
connection must be identified first to the Service or Agency Cross Domain Support Element
(CDSE), e.g., CA SAPCO, AO. All cross domain connections shall comply with the security
controls identified by the UCDSMO.
The direct connection of any information system to an external network is prohibited. No
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-104
direct connection means that an information system cannot connect to an external network
without the use of an approved boundary protection device (e.g., firewall or cross domain
device) that mediates the communication between the system and the network.
Control Enhancements:
(2) (1) SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS | UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONNECTIONS
The organization prohibits the direct connection of an all unclassified NSS to an external network without the use of
[Assignment: organization-defined boundary protection device].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate communications
(i.e., information flows) between unclassified national security systems and external networks. This
control enhancement is required for organizations processing, storing, or transmitting Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI).
SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS | CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONNECTIONS
The organization prohibits the direct connection of a classified, national security system to an external network
without the use of [Assignment: organization-defined boundary protection device].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate communications
(i.e., information flows) between classified national security systems and external networks. In
addition, approved boundary protection devices (typically managed interface/cross-domain systems)
provide information flow enforcement from information systems to external networks.
(3) SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS | UNCLASSIFIED NON-NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONNECTIONS
The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment: organization-defined unclassified, non-national
security system] to an external network without the use of [Assignment; organization-defined boundary protection
device].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate communications
(i.e., information flows) between unclassified non-national security systems and external networks.
This control enhancement is required for organizations processing, storing, or transmitting Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI).
(4) SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS | CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC NETWORKS
The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment: organization-defined information system] to a
public network.
Supplemental Guidance: A public network is any network accessible to the general public including, for
example, the Internet and organizational extranets with public access.
(5) SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS | RESTRICTIONS ON EXTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS
The organization employs deny-all, permit-by-exception policy for allowing all systems to connect to external
information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can constrain information system connectivity to external domains
(e.g., websites) by employing one of two policies with regard to such connectivity: (i) allow-all, deny by
exception, also known as blacklisting (the weaker of the two policies); or (ii) deny-all, allow by exception,
also known as whitelisting (the stronger of the two policies). For either policy, organizations determine
what exceptions, if any, are acceptable. Related control: CM-7.

CA-4 SECURITY CERTIFICATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-2].
CA-5 PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES
Control: The organization:
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-105
a. b. Develops a plan of action and milestones for the information system to document the organization’s
planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the
security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and
Updates existing plan of action and milestones at least quarterly based on the findings from security
controls assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities.
Supplemental Guidance: Plans of action and milestones are key documents in security authorization packages
and are subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-
4, PM-4.
POA&Ms are the authoritative management tool used by the organization (including the AO,
SCA, PSO) to detail specific program and system level security weaknesses, remediation
needs, the resources required to implement the plan, and scheduled completion dates.
The POA&M is initiated based on findings and recommendations from the SAR, or as a
minimum, providing that information via the SAR to the ISO.
The ISO shall describe the planned tasks for correcting weaknesses and addressing any
residual findings. The POA&M shall identify:
• Tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion either before or
after information system implementation.
• Resources required to accomplish the tasks.
• Any milestones in meeting the tasks, to include percentage completed.
• Scheduled completion dates for the milestones.
• Status of tasks (completed, ongoing, delayed, planned)
The POA&M is used by the AO and SCA to monitor the progress in mitigating any findings.
POA&M entries are required even when weaknesses or deficiencies are remediated during
the assessment or prior to the submission of the authorization package to the AO. Once an
authorization is issued with a POA&M, adjusting the approved milestones and scheduled
completion dates is not allowed without coordination with AO.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES | AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR ACCURACY / CURRENCY
The organization employs automated mechanisms to help ensure that the plan of action and milestones for the
information system is accurate, up to date, and readily available.
References: OMB Memorandum 02-01; NIST Special Publication 800-37.
a. b. c. CA-6 SECURITY AUTHORIZATION
Control: The organization:
Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the information system;
Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before
commencing operations; and
Updates the security authorization if the organization and/or system is adequately covered by a
continuous monitoring program the Security Authorization may be continuously updated: If
not; at least every three (3) years, when significant security breaches occur, whenever there is a
significant change to the system, or to the environment in which the system operates.
Supplemental Guidance: Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through
authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e., authorizing
officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-106
agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational
information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business operations supported by those
systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing
officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials
assume responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of
organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions with levels of
authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB
policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing
continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization
requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of
comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages
(i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an
ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date status of
the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation. To reduce the
administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous
monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.
Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.
The Cybersecurity enclosure to DoDM 5205.07-V1 provides policy for assigning the AO
with authority to authorize systems to operate under their purview. [CA-6.a] The ISO and
ISSM/ISSO must ensure the system is authorized for processing by the AO before
commencing operations.
Joint Authorization vs. Reciprocity
Joint authorization (formerly joint accreditation) to operate differs from reciprocity in that
‘joint’ indicates that decisions about the system, how it will operate, which controls apply,
who will assess the system as well as factors related to the actual authorization assessment
are all decided up-front together, or jointly. In most cases, two or more organizations
support the assessment and jointly determine authorization to operate.
Reciprocity is defined as a “Mutual agreement among participating enterprises to accept each
other’s security assessments in order to reuse information system resources and/or to accept
each other’s assessed security posture in order to share information.” [CNSSI 4009]
Reciprocity applies when an information system is currently authorized to operate by one AO
and it is later determined that it would prove beneficial to one or both parties if the
information systems are connected or authorized to share data across system, programs, or
service boundaries.
Reciprocity does not imply blind acceptance. Upon request, the body of evidence used for
assessments of the subject system will be provided to the other AOs who have a vested
interest in establishing a mutual agreement. The receiving party will review the assessment
evidence (e.g., SSP, test plans, test procedures, test reports, exceptions) and determine if
there are any deltas in the evidence, e.g., baseline/overlay controls that were tailored, a test
item that was omitted and identify items that may require negotiations. Reciprocity means
that the system(s) will not undergo another full assessment.
Varying security domains (collateral, SAP, sensitive compartmented information (SCI))
implement security measures based on their operating environment. A receiving
organization reviews controls to ensure enhanced security measures pertinent to the receiving
environment are appropriately addressed. The SSP/SCTM for a collateral system coming
into a SAP environment should be reviewed and updated to reflect requirements for
implementation in a SAP environment, e.g., media protection, personnel clearance and
accesses, incident response and reporting, interconnections.
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-107
Organizations have the right to refuse reciprocity due to an insufficient security authorization
package or excessive risk to the enclave or site as determined by the AO.
Ensure the CA SAPCO is aware of discussions concerning reciprocal agreements with
entities outside of the organization, including reciprocity with the IC, other DoD SAPCOs, or
the DoD Collateral Community.
Site-Based Authorization (SBA)
The AO may choose an alternate authorization approach that consolidates all systems at a
location into a single management entity called a "Site." The size and bounds of each site are
determined by the relationship of each system (component) to the infrastructure, command
lines of authority, and the span of control of the site's ISSM. Site authorization begins with
all systems at the site being assessed and authorized. The site is then authorized as a single
entity and a single ATO is issued for systems falling under the Site Baseline. The ISSM may
be delegated the authority to add ‘like’ systems or ‘like’ networks (i.e., for systems where not
all users have a need to know), provided those systems do not extend beyond the site
boundaries.
A Site IA Security Concept of Operations (CONOPS) or IA SOP, a system baseline of all
approved systems, and a Site Security Architecture are the minimum documents required to
be considered for SBA. These shall contain a listing of all systems covered under the site
based authorization, a description of how the site complies with the requirements of this
manual (i.e., RMF controls), and a wiring diagram showing external connections. The AO
will be provided periodic updates to the baseline, and the continued authorization as a Site
under SBA will be assessed annually in conjunction with the Security Review process.
Security Authorization Package
The ISO is responsible for submitting the Security Authorization Package to the SCA, who,
in turn, submits the security authorization package to the AO. For information systems
inheriting common controls for specific security capabilities, the security authorization
package for the common controls or a reference to such documentation must also be included
in the authorization package. When security controls are provided to an organization by an
external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business
arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization
shall ensure the information needed by the AO to make a risk-based decision is made
available by the control provider. The security authorization package will contain, at a
minimum, the SSP (including the SCTM, ConMon Strategy or Plan, and RAR), SAR, and
POA&M. In addition, the Security Assessment Plan may be required by the AO. The
complexity of the RAR and ConMon Strategy vary by system and environment. Guidance
on the level of detail required is provided by the AO/SCA. The AO may request additional
documentation.

CA-7 CONTINUOUS MONITORING
References: OMB Circular A-130; OMB Memorandum 11-33; NIST Special Publications 800-37, 800-137.
Control: The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous
monitoring program that includes:
Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be monitored;
a. Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-108
b. c. d. e. f. g. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and [Assignment:
organization-defined frequencies] for assessments supporting such monitoring;
Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring
strategy;
Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the
organizational continuous monitoring strategy;
Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring;
Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related information; and
Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment: organization-
defined personnel or roles] at least annually or when there is a significant change to the system,
or to the environment in which the system operates.
Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms
continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and information security-
related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions. The results of
continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous
monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information
systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing
mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related
information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to
make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization
decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages,
hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced
when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable,
actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security
categories of information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM-9, RA-5,
SA-11, SA-12, SI-2, SI-4.
This strategy will drive the development of organizational Information Security Continuous
Monitoring (ISCM) or ConMon Plans. ConMon Plan allows an organization to maintain the
security authorization of its information systems over time in a highly dynamic environment
with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes.
Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools facilitates near
real-time risk management and promotes organizational situational awareness with regard to
the security state of the information system.
The ultimate objective of continuous monitoring is to achieve a state of ongoing
authorization where the AO maintains sufficient knowledge of the current security state of
the information systems under their purview (including the effectiveness of the security
controls employed within and inherited by the system). This information is used to
determine whether continued operation maintains an acceptable level of risk in accordance
with the AO. If a formal reauthorization action is required, the organization maximizes the
use of security and risk-related information produced during the continuous monitoring and
ongoing authorization processes.
Continuous monitoring assists organizations with ongoing updates to SSPs and POA&Ms
and minimizes the level of effort required for subsequent security assessment activities.
Control Enhancements:
(1) CONTINUOUS MONITORING | INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT
The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined level of
independence] to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-109
(2) (3) Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security controls
during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be conducted by
assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on continuous monitoring
strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To
achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the
organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as
management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy
positions for the organizations acquiring their services.
CONTINUOUS MONITORING | TYPES OF ASSESSMENTS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-2.]
CONTINUOUS MONITORING | TREND ANALYSES
The organization employs trend analyses to determine if security control implementations, the frequency of
continuous monitoring activities, and/or the types of activities used in the continuous monitoring process need to be
modified based on empirical data.
Supplemental Guidance: Trend analyses can include, for example, examining recent threat information
regarding the types of threat events that have occurred within the organization or across the federal
government, success rates of certain types of cyber attacks, emerging vulnerabilities in information
technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, results from multiple security control
assessments, the effectiveness of configuration settings, and findings from Inspectors General or
auditors.

CA-8 PENETRATION TESTING
Control: The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] on
[Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on information
systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.
Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance
organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time,
resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out
hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related
weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability analyses to support
penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware
components of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical security controls. A
standard method for penetration testing includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge
of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii)
testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of
engagement before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the
penetration testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be
employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on the level
of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. Related control: SA-12.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PENETRATION TESTING | INDEPENDENT PENETRATION AGENT OR TEAM
The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform penetration testing on
the information system or system components.
Supplemental Guidance: Independent penetration agents or teams are individuals or groups who conduct
impartial penetration testing of organizational information systems. Impartiality implies that
penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to the
development, operation, or management of the information systems that are the targets of the
penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2 (1) provides additional information regarding
independent assessments that can be applied to penetration testing. Related control: CA-2.
Chapter 3-CA PAGE 3-110
(2) PENETRATION TESTING | RED TEAM EXERCISES
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises] to simulate attempts by
adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined
rules of engagement].
Supplemental Guidance: Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining
the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective cyber defenses. As such,
red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial attempts to compromise organizational
mission/business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security state of
information systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to compromise organizational
missions/business functions and the information systems that support those missions/functions may
include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions with hardware, software, or firmware
components and/or mission/business processes) and social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions
via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations). While penetration testing may be
largely laboratory-based testing, organizations use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive
assessments that reflect real-world conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve security
awareness and training and to assess levels of security control effectiveness.

a. b. CA-9 INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS
Control: The organization:
Authorizes internal connections of [Assignment: organization-defined information system components
or classes of components] to the information system; and
Documents, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the
nature of the information communicated.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to connections between organizational information systems and
(separate) constituent system components (i.e., intra-system connections) including, for example, system
connections with mobile devices, notebook/desktop computers, printers, copiers, facsimile machines,
scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each individual internal connection, organizations can
authorize internal connections for a class of components with common characteristics and/or
configurations, for example, all digital printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, storage,
and transmission capability or all smart phones with a specific baseline configuration. Related controls:
AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AU-2, AU-12, CA-7, CM-2, IA-3, SC-7, SI-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS | SECURITY COMPLIANCE CHECKS
The information system performs security compliance checks on constituent system components prior to the
establishment of the internal connection.
Supplemental Guidance: Security compliance checks may include, for example, verification of the
relevant baseline configuration. Related controls: CM-6.

FAMILY: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
CM-1 a. 2. b. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. A configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management policy and associated
configuration management controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Configuration management policy at least annually; and
Configuration management procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CM family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

CM-2 BASELINE CONFIGURATION
Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains under configuration control, a current
baseline configuration of the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems and system
components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems. Baseline
configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information
systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future
builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include information about
information system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and patch
information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings/parameters), network
topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Maintaining
baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change over
time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture. Related
controls: CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9, SA-10, PM-5, PM-7.
Baseline configuration includes the documentation required in CM-6 (including
configuration settings and hardening applied to the system and software), CM-7 (including
requirements for whitelisting software) and CM-8 (hardware inventory).
Reference Supply Chain Protection [SA-12] and the AO’s recommended software approval
process prior to acquisition of software. All non-US developed software requires AO
approval prior to procurement.
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-112
Foreign Ownership, Control, and Influence (FOCI) review must be accomplished for any
hardware/software introduction, version change or upgrade not previously approved for use
on SAP systems. Hardware/software procured through non-DoD channels, or which may
have a foreign origin, may only be used with an appropriate justification and AO approval.
A baseline configuration may represent different information computing environments such
as development, test, and production. Organizations shall maintain a baseline configuration
for development and test environments that is managed separately from the operational
baseline configuration.
ISOs must ensure that software included on an IS baseline is managed. Document means of
system copyright and IP compliance mechanisms within CM-10.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) BASELINE CONFIGURATION | REVIEWS AND UPDATES
The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system:
(a) At least annually;
(b) When required due to significant or security relevant changes or security incidents occur; and
(c) As an integral part of information system component installations and upgrades.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: CM-5.
BASELINE CONFIGURATION | AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR ACCURACY / CURRENCY
The organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily
available baseline configuration of the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline
configurations for information systems include, for example, hardware and software inventory tools,
configuration management tools, and network management tools. Such tools can be deployed and/or
allocated as common controls, at the information system level, or at the operating system or
component level (e.g., on workstations, servers, notebook computers, network components, or mobile
devices). Tools can be used, for example, to track version numbers on operating system applications,
types of software installed, and current patch levels. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the
implementation of CM-8 (2) for organizations that choose to combine information system component
inventory and baseline configuration activities. Related controls: CM-7, RA-5.
BASELINE CONFIGURATION | RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS
The organization retains at least two previous versions of baseline configurations of the information system to
support rollback.
Supplemental Guidance: Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback may
include, for example, hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, and configuration records.
BASELINE CONFIGURATION | UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7].
BASELINE CONFIGURATION | AUTHORIZED SOFTWARE
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7].
BASELINE CONFIGURATION | DEVELOPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENTS
The organization maintains a baseline configuration for information system development and test environments that
is managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.
Supplemental Guidance: Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and
operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected events related
to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the
configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example,
management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while
management of development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test
environment mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable so that
the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems. This
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-113
(7) (b) control enhancement requires separate configurations but not necessarily separate physical
environments. Related controls: CM-4, SC-3, SC-7.
BASELINE CONFIGURATION | CONFIGURE SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, OR DEVICES FOR HIGH-RISK AREAS
The organization:
(a) Issues [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices] with
[Assignment: organization-defined configurations] to individuals traveling to locations that the organization
deems to be of significant risk; and
Applies [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to the devices when the individuals return.
Supplemental Guidance: When it is known that information systems, system components, or devices
(e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk areas, additional security
controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat in such areas coupled with the lack of
physical security relative to organizational-controlled areas. For example, organizational policies and
procedures for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel include,
for example, determining which locations are of concern, defining required configurations for the
devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying
specific safeguards to the device after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers
include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional
hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices
upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical tampering and
purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered in
the media protection family.
SAP Systems leaving the facility should ensure that integrity configuration settings are
applied. (Example: using Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or Secure Boot functions)
References: NIST Special Publication 800-128.
a. b. c. d. e. f. CM-3 CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL
Control: The organization:
Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled;
Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or
disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses;
Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system;
Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system;
Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for one (1) year or one
(1) security review cycle, whichever is longer;
Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the information
system; and
Coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through [Assignment:
organization-defined configuration change control element (e.g., committee, board)] that convenes
[Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-
defined configuration change conditions]].
Supplemental Guidance: Configuration change controls for organizational information systems involve the
systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the
systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to
baseline configurations for components and configuration items of information systems, changes to
configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls,
routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.
Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems include, for example,
Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed changes to systems. For new development
information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including
g. Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-114
representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes
includes activities before and after changes are made to organizational information systems and the
auditing activities required to implement such changes. Related controls: CA-7, CM-2, CM-4, CM-5, CM-
6, CM-9, SA-10, SI-2, SI-12.
All hardware and software changes to DoD SAP IS must go through a configuration change
control process. Configuration change control is the documented process for managing and
controlling changes to the configuration of an IS.
Security Relevant – any hardware or software that is “security enforcing,” “security
supporting,” or “security non-interfering” which can affect an IS’s configuration,
functionality, or users’ privileges, and has the potential to change the risk imposed on the IS.
• Security Enforcing – Operating System (OS), access control applications, audit
applications, device control applications, second party applications that perform IA,
account management, anti-virus, firewall; capable of making changes to the security
substructure of the system: modifies a user’s account or changes permissions on objects
such as enforcing Discretionary access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control
(MAC), Network Access Control (NAC).
• Security Supporting – Impacts a security process or procedures: e.g., software used to
perform technical review for AFT; software that is only used by privileged users of the
system in the performance of their duties; removing a backup server which may affect
availability; code or script that authenticates the user and determines authorization.
• Security Non-Interfering – Does not enforce or support any aspect of the system
security policy, but due to its presence inside the security boundary, e.g., code running a
privileged hardware mode within the OS, risk is elevated.
Significant security-relevant changes will require assessment and may require re-
authorization of the information system. A concept of operations or revised SSP will be
submitted to the AO for approval outlining the implementation and assessment process.
Documented AO authorization is required prior to implementing a security-relevant change,
examples (not all-inclusive) include:
• Changes that modify the security support structure.
• Operating system changes (e.g., Windows 7 to Windows 10).
• Security Relevant software version upgrades (e.g., Update to Microsoft Office
beyond AFT tool capabilities, firmware update for security appliances).
• Addition of security relevant software not previously approved for the systems.
• Addition of new server function.
• New hardware models
• Modification to system ports, protocols and services (PPS).
• Major vulnerabilities discovered after assessment and/or authorization.
• Changes to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability requirements (e.g., changing
from a moderate impact level to high impact level).
• Changes in system encryption methods.
• Changes to interconnections.
• Changes to operating environment (e.g., external information system introduces
media capability; introduction of Voice over Internet Protocol (IP) (VoIP) (classified
or unclassified); foreign nationals move in next door; system is relocated).
• Significant increased threat increasing the organization/site’s residual risk.
Minor and non-security relevant hardware and software changes to information systems may
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-115
require AO authorization. These upgrades require an administrative update to the SSP.
Examples of non-security-relevant changes include:
• Non-security relevant software version updates and/or upgrades.
• Addition of identical workstation type with approved image to an authorized system.
• Replacement of failed servers/system components with identical spares.
• Replacement of hard drives/tape back-up.
The addition of any server/workstation identified in the paragraph above requires the
ISSM/ISSO to review the test results pre and post connection to ensure the information
system has been configured in accordance with the approved artifacts. If in doubt on the
significance of a change, the SCA shall be contacted to determine whether a change is
significant.
A Configuration Control Board (CCB) acts as a check and balance on configuration change
activity, assuring that proposed changes are held to organizationally defined criteria (e.g.,
scope, cost, impact on security) before being implemented. CM-3 g. organization-defined
values should establish the element responsible for approving change. A CCB can be as big
or small as it needs to be for the information system environment that it supports.
Since the ISSM is responsible for halting practices dangerous to security, the ISSM shall
have authority to veto any proposed change he/she believes to be detrimental to security. In
cases of disagreement, the change shall be postponed while the ISO or ISSM contacts the
AO’s office for resolution. Reference CA-6.
Modifying, relocating, or reconfiguring the hardware of any computer system must be
approved by the CCB for each site. Hardware will not be connected to any system/network
without the express written consent of the ISSM/ISSO and the CCB.
Modifying, installing, or downloading any software on any computer system may affect
system authorization and must be evaluated and approved by the ISSM/ISSO with the local
CCB.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED DOCUMENT / NOTIFICATION / PROHIBITION OF CHANGES
The organization employs automated mechanisms to:
(a) Document proposed changes to the information system;
(b) Notify [Assignment: organized-defined approval authorities] of proposed changes to the information system and
request change approval;
(c) Highlight proposed changes to the information system that have not been approved or disapproved by
[Assignment: organization-defined time period];
(d) Prohibit changes to the information system until designated approvals are received;
(e) Document all changes to the information system; and
(f) Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel] when approved changes to the information system are
completed.
CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | TEST / VALIDATE / DOCUMENT CHANGES
The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before implementing the
changes on the operational system.
Supplemental Guidance: Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or
firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations ensure that testing
does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups conducting tests understand
organizational security policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures,
and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with particular facilities/processes.
Operational systems may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-116
(3) (4) can be conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to
occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational
systems, organizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).
CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION
The organization employs automated mechanisms to implement changes to the current information system baseline
and deploys the updated baseline across the installed base.
CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE
The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the configuration change
control element defined in CM-3 g.
Supplemental Guidance: Information security representatives can include, for example, senior agency
information security officers, information system security officers, or information system security
managers. Representation by personnel with information security expertise is important because
changes to information system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be
security-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can help avoid unintended, negative
consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of organizational information systems. The
configuration change control element in this control enhancement reflects the change control elements
defined by organizations in CM-3.
As indicated in JSIG, Section 1.5.14.q, ISSM responsibilities include serving as a
member of the CCB.
(5) (6) CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED SECURITY RESPONSE
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security responses] automatically if baseline
configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.
Supplemental Guidance: Security responses include, for example, halting information system processing,
halting selected system functions, or issuing alerts/notifications to organizational personnel when there
is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.
CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | CRYPTOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT
The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide safeguarding of classified information
from unauthorized access or modification are under configuration management.
Supplemental Guidance: Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key, private key,
shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures in place to effectively
manage those means. For example, if devices use certificates as a basis for identification and
authentication, there needs to be a process in place to address the expiration of those certificates.
Related control: SC-13.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-128.
CM-4 SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS
Control: The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential security
impacts prior to change implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g.,
Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System Security
Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals
conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the changes
to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for
example, reviewing security plans to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design
documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes might affect the controls.
Security impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the
changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in
accordance with the security categories of the information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3,
CM-9, SA-4, SA-5, SA-10, SI-2.
Security impact analysis is the deliberate consideration of the impact of a change on the
security state of the information system. ISs are typically in a constant state of change, it is
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-117
important to understand the impact of changes on the functionality of existing security
controls. Security impact analysis must be incorporated into the documented configuration
change control process. The ISSM/ISSO shall be involved in determining if a configuration
change has a security impact. Factors considered in assessing software risk involve:
1. Importation of malicious content
This is essentially a supply chain issue. Although we perceive that US sources are
less likely to target the US, with multi-national firms and commercial open source,
software (like hardware) comes from everywhere. That said, most of the
repositories attempt to be malware free.
2. Importation of vulnerable content
This factor relates to code quality including software assurance that the libraries
used by applications are updated and that latent vulnerabilities in the executables
are addressed/mitigated/removed.
3. Remediation of functional or security deficiencies in operational software
This factor addresses effective sustainment to determine if the developer addresses
identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner. It’s not uncommon to have open
source firms have patches posted in a few days where the commercial firms may
lag for months. When developers and vendors abandon products (for various
reasons), it can leave the consumer with orphan or zombie software. It can take
deep pockets to pay for sustainment and delay an end-of-life deadline.
4. Legal compliance
Licensing, copyrights, and intellectual property rights vary dependent on the
software type, e.g., open source software, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS).
5. Costs of the four factors above
Cost is often linked to platform and applications. For example, open source
software is more common in the *nix environments (e.g., UNIX, LINIX), than in
Windows, where the greatest cost tends to be for sustainment and licensing.
Hardware tends to follow a similar process with an additional focus on whether a device
contains non-volatile memory and malicious content.
SAP systems with moderate and high integrity are required to have a test environment.
Integrity low systems should consider impact of the change to their operational environment
and ensure the change is implemented in the least disruptive manner.
If the security impact analysis results in significant security-relevant changes, documented
approval is required from the AO in accordance with (IAW) CM-3. Reference CA-6.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS | SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS
The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test environment before implementation
in an operational environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional
malice.
Supplemental Guidance: Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is
physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment. The separation is
sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the operational
environment, and information in the operational environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test
environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or logical means. If physically
separate test environments are not used, organizations determine the strength of mechanism required
when implementing logical separation (e.g., separation achieved through virtual machines). Related
controls: SA-11, SC-3, SC-7.
SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS | VERIFICATION OF SECURITY FUNCTIONS
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-118
The organization, after the information system is changed, checks the security functions to verify that the functions
are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the
security requirements for the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Implementation is this context refers to installing changed code in the
operational information system. Related control: SA-11.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-128.
CM-5 ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE
Control: The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and logical access
restrictions associated with changes to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of information
systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore,
organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes
of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations maintain records of access to
ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should
organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software
libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-
3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party
interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only
during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover). Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-
3.
Access restrictions for change represent the enforcement side of security configuration
management. Configuration change control is a process for funneling changes to an IS
through a managed process; however, without access restrictions, there is nothing preventing
someone from implementing changes outside the process. Access restrictions are a
mechanism to enforce configuration control processes by controlling who has access to the
IS to make changes.
Organizations are responsible for conducting scans or audits to validate configuration
changes were implemented as intended and for supporting after-the-fact actions if
unauthorized changes to the IS are detected.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | AUTOMATED ACCESS ENFORCEMENT / AUDITING
The information system enforces access restrictions and supports auditing of the enforcement actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, AU-6, CM-3, CM-6.
ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | REVIEW SYSTEM CHANGES
The organization reviews information system changes every 90 days or more frequently as the organization
defines for high integrity systems AND at least annually or more frequently as the organization defines for
low integrity and moderate integrity systems and when there is an incident or when planned changes have
been performed to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred.
Supplemental Guidance: Indications that warrant review of information system changes and the specific
circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried out by organizations
during the configuration change process. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7, CM-3, CM-5, PE-6, PE-8.
ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | SIGNED COMPONENTS
The information system prevents the installation of all digitally signed software and firmware products without
verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the
organization.
Supplemental Guidance: Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed
with recognized and approved certificates include, for example, software and firmware version
updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input output system (BIOS) updates.
Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-119
(4) (5) (6) (7) a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures, is a
method of code authentication. Related controls: CM-7, SC-13, SI-7.
ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
The organization enforces dual authorization for implementing changes to [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components and system-level information].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that any changes to selected
information system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals
implement such changes. The two individuals possess sufficient skills/expertise to determine if the
proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. Dual authorization may also be
known as two-person control. Related controls: AC-5, CM-3.
ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | LIMIT PRODUCTION / OPERATIONAL PRIVILEGES
The organization:
(a) Limits privileges to change information system components and system-related information within a production
or operational environment; and
(b) Reviews and reevaluates privileges at least quarterly.
Supplemental Guidance: In many organizations, information systems support multiple core
missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components with
respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a particular information system
component may have far-reaching effects on mission/business processes supported by the system
where the component resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and
mission/business processes are in some cases, unknown to developers. Related control: AC-2.
ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | LIMIT LIBRARY PRIVILEGES
The organization limits privileges to change software resident within software libraries.
Supplemental Guidance: Software libraries include privileged programs. Related control: AC-2.

a. c. CM-6 CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
Control: The organization:
Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products employed
within the information system using organizationally approved guides such as DoD SRGs, STIGs,
NIST Security Configuration Checklists, Service specific guidance or NSA SCGs; if such a
reference document is not available, the following are acceptable in descending order as
available: (1) Commercially accepted practices (e.g., SANS) (2) Independent testing results (e.g.,
ICSA) or (3) Vendor literature that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational
requirements;
b. Implements the configuration settings;
Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for all
configurable information system components based on [Assignment: organization-defined
operational requirements]; and
Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies
and procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware,
software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security posture and/or
functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration
settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail,
authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers,
and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless
access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-
d. Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-120
related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the
parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for
example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions,
ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration
settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become
part of the systems configuration baseline.
Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and
hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized,
standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific
information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system
components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a
variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers,
vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private
sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline
(USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g.,
Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control
configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal
information systems. Related controls: AC-19, CM-2, CM-3, CM-7, SI-4.
The information system must conform to security configuration guidance (i.e., security
checklists), prior to being introduced into a production environment. Exceptions from the
mandatory configuration settings for individual components within the IS based on explicit
operational requirements require AO approval and should be revalidated by the organization
IAW continuous monitoring plan.
Organizations shall monitor and control changes to the configuration settings. Any detected
unauthorized security-relevant configuration changes to an information system must be
documented and reported as a possible incident. See also the Incident Response family.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) CONFIGURATION SETTINGS | AUTOMATED CENTRAL MANAGEMENT / APPLICATION / VERIFICATION
The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CA-7, CM-4.
CONFIGURATION SETTINGS | RESPOND TO UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to respond to unauthorized
changes to [Assignment: organization-defined configuration settings].
Supplemental Guidance: Responses to unauthorized changes to configuration settings can include, for
example, alerting designated organizational personnel, restoring established configuration settings, or
in extreme cases, halting affected information system processing. Related controls: IR-4, SI-7.

CM-7 LEAST FUNCTIONALITY
Control: The organization:
a. Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities; and
b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or services:
[Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or
services].
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of
the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational
operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple
services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services
provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single
function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and
services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine
which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant
Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary
physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized
transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools,
intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based
intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and
services. Related controls: AC-6, CM-2, RA-5, SA-5, SC-7.
Least functionality helps to minimize the potential for introduction of security vulnerabilities
and includes, but is not limited to, disabling or uninstalling unused/unnecessary operating
system (OS) functionality, protocols, ports, and services, and limiting the software that can
be installed and the functionality of that software.
Organizations shall:
• Configure information systems and components to provide only essential
capabilities. This includes allowing only the necessary ports, protocols, and services
in accordance with functional needs, as defined in DoDI 8551.1, Ports, Protocols,
and Services Management (PPSM) and DISA STIGs. This requirement must also
consider the risk tolerance of the organization.
• Obtain and ensure compliance with the latest guidance regarding ports, protocols,
and services.
• Configure information systems and components to disable the capability for
automatic execution of code (e.g., AutoRun, AutoPlay).
Control Enhancements:
(1) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | PERIODIC REVIEW
The organization:
(a) Reviews the information system at least annually or as system changes or incidents occur to identify
unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and
(b) Disables all functions, ports, protocols, and services within the information system deemed to be
unnecessary and/or nonsecure.
Supplemental Guidance: The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the
function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities.
Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure protocols. Related
controls: AC-18, CM-7, IA-2.
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-122
(2) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | PREVENT PROGRAM EXECUTION
The information system prevents program execution in accordance with [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
organization-defined policies regarding software program usage and restrictions]; rules authorizing the terms and
conditions of software program usage].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-8, PM-5.
Systems prevent program execution from organizationally specific locations: (e.g.,
removable media, temporary directory, a shared network drive, etc.)
(3) (4) (b) (c) (5) LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | REGISTRATION COMPLIANCE
The organization ensures compliance with [Assignment: organization-defined registration requirements for functions,
ports, protocols, and services].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and provide
oversight for information systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols, and services.
LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE / BLACKLISTING
The organization:
(a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs not authorized to execute on the information
system];
Employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized software programs on
the information system; and
Reviews and updates the list of unauthorized software programs at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to
execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. Organizations
can implement CM-7 (5) instead of this control enhancement if whitelisting (the stronger of the two
policies) is the preferred approach for restricting software program execution. Related controls: CM-6,
CM-8, PM-5.
LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | AUTHORIZED SOFTWARE / WHITELISTING
The organization:
(a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized to execute on the information
system];
Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs on the
information system; and
Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute
on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. In addition to
whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software programs using, for
example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed
software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, CM-
8, PM-5, SA-10, SC-34, SI-7.
(b) (c) The organization develops and maintains an approved software list, for a specific
information system. Change to this list is managed within CM-3.
Demonstration software is any software used for demonstrations, with the intent of
being returned to the vendor and must be processed on a computer that has never
processed or stored classified information.
Unauthorized software – All software must have a valid mission requirement. Types of
software that are not authorized and must be waived in writing by the AO prior to
introduction the SAP IS include:
• Games
• Public domain software or “shareware” which is obtained from unofficial
channels (as defined by CNSSI 4009), any software not protected by copyright
laws of any nation that may be freely used without permission of, or payment to

the creator, and that carries no warranties from, or liabilities to the creator.
• All software applications which have been developed outside government-
approved facilities, such as those developed on personally owned computers at
home or software acquired via non-government ‘bulletin boards
• Personally owned software or software purchased using employee funds (either
purchased or gratuitously acquired)
• Software from unknown sources
• Illegally copied software in violation of copyright rules
• Software used for purposes other than allowed and specified in the End User
License Agreement (EULA).
• Music and video or multimedia compact disks not procured through official
Government channels
• Software used to conduct business outside of official government duties

a. CM-8 INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY
Control: The organization:
Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:
1. Accurately reflects the current information system;
2. Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;
3. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and
4. Includes minimally but not limited to: hardware specifications (manufacturer, type, model,
serial number, physical location), software and software license information, information
system/component owner, and for a networked component/device, the machine name; and
b. Reviews and updates the information system component inventory at least annually
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component
inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In such situations,
organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper
component accountability (e.g., information system association, information system owner). Information
deemed necessary for effective accountability of information system components includes, for example,
hardware inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component
owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory
specifications include, for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.
Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PM-5.
The IS component inventory is a list of the physically identifiable components within an IS.
The inventory must be available for review and audit by designated organizational officials.
Each IS component should be associated with only one IS and the authority over and
responsibility for each IS component should be with only one ISO (i.e., every item in the IS
component inventory should fall within the authorization boundary of a single IS).
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | UPDATES DURING INSTALLATIONS / REMOVALS
The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an integral part of component
installations, removals, and information system updates.
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE
The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily
available inventory of information system components.
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-124
(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Supplemental Guidance: Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent feasible.
Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the
network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate
an inventory as is deemed reasonable. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the
implementation of CM-2 (2) for organizations that choose to combine information system component
inventory and baseline configuration activities. Related control: SI-7.
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED UNAUTHORIZED COMPONENT DETECTION
The organization:
(a) Employs automated mechanisms continuously to detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software,
and firmware components within the information system; and
(b) Takes the following actions when unauthorized components are detected: [Selection (one or more): disables
network access by such components; isolates the components; notifies [Assignment: organization-defined
personnel or roles]].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is applied in addition to the monitoring for
unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for unauthorized system components
may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose.
Automated mechanisms can be implemented within information systems or in other separate devices.
Isolation can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized information system components in
separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining such components. This type of component
isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-7, SI-3,
SI-4, SI-7, RA-5.
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION
The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means for identifying
minimally by position or role, individuals responsible/accountable for administering those components.
Supplemental Guidance: Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for
administering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components are
properly administered and organizations can contact those individuals if some action is required (e.g.,
component is determined to be the source of a breach/compromise, component needs to be
recalled/replaced, or component needs to be relocated).
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | NO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTING OF COMPONENTS
The organization verifies that all components within the authorization boundary of the information system are not
duplicated in other information system component inventories.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the potential problem of duplicate
accounting of information system components in large or complex interconnected systems.
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSESSED CONFIGURATIONS / APPROVED DEVIATIONS
The organization includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to current deployed
configurations in the information system component inventory.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on configuration settings established by
organizations for information system components, the specific components that have been assessed to
determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved deviations from
established configuration settings. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY
The organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system components.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system
component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems.
Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide opportunities for
efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and firmware assets. Such
repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of
system components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation
actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized inventories include system-specific
information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association,
information system owner).
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-125
(8) (9) INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED LOCATION TRACKING
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support tracking of information system components by
geographic location.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of information system
components can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may also help
organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have
been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions.
INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS
The organization:
(a) Assigns all acquired information system components to an information system; and
(b) Receives an acknowledgement from the information system owner of this assignment.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the criteria for or types of information system
components (e.g., microprocessors, motherboards, software, programmable logic controllers, and
network devices) that are subject to this control enhancement. Related control: SA-4.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-128.
a. b. c. d. CM-9 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN
Control: The organization develops, documents, and implements a configuration management plan for the
information system that:
Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;
Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development life cycle
and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;
Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the configuration items under
configuration management; and
Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Supplemental Guidance: Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
management policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define detailed
processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life
cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically developed
during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to
move changes through change management processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines,
how to maintain information system component inventories, how to control development, test, and
operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations can
employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration
management plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the
organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration
management approval processes include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for
reviewing and approving proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security
impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the
information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed.
As information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may
be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.
Related controls: CM-2, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-8, SA-10.
A Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan) is a comprehensive description of the roles,
responsibilities, policies, and procedures that apply when managing the configuration of
products and systems. Organizations are responsible for developing a CM Plan for all
information systems under their purview. The plan must define CM roles, responsibilities,
processes and procedures. It must further define the configuration items for the IS and
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-126
establish a process for managing the configuration of the configuration items throughout the
system development life cycle. ISO responsibilities include:
• Documenting the CM process when new IS are under development, being procured,
or delivered for operation. An integral part of CM is the System Authorization
process. Therefore, it is imperative that AOs or designees be advised of CM
decisions. This will ensure systems are fielded or modified within acceptable risk
parameters and the latest security technology is being incorporated into system
designs. This participation is most important at the Preliminary Design Review
(PDR) and the Critical Design Review (CDR).
ISSM responsibilities include:
• Ensuring development and implementation of procedures in accordance with CM
policies and procedures for authorizing the use of hardware/software on an IS.
• Ensuring all additions, changes or modifications to hardware, software, or firmware
are documented and that security relevant changes are coordinated, via the SCA,
with the AO or appropriately delegated individual.
• Serving as a voting member on the CCB.
ISSO responsibilities include:
• Ensuring CM for IS software and hardware are maintained and documented.
• Following procedures developed by the ISSM, in accordance with CM policies and
procedures, for authorizing software use prior to its implementation on a system.
Any changes or modifications to hardware, software, or firmware of a system must
be coordinated with the ISSM.
Control Enhancements:
(1) CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN | ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
The organization assigns responsibility for developing the configuration management process to organizational
personnel that are not directly involved in information system development.
Supplemental Guidance: In the absence of dedicated configuration management teams assigned within
organizations, system developers may be tasked to develop configuration management processes using
personnel who are not directly involved in system development or integration. This separation of
duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a sufficient degree of independence between
the information system development and integration processes and configuration management
processes to facilitate quality control and more effective oversight.

a. b. CM-10 SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS
Control: The organization:
Uses software and associated documentation in accordance with contract agreements and copyright
laws;
Tracks the use of software and associated documentation protected by quantity licenses to control
copying and distribution; and
Controls and documents the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability is
not used for the unauthorized distribution, display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.
Supplemental Guidance: Software license tracking can be accomplished by manual methods (e.g., simple
spreadsheets) or automated methods (e.g., specialized tracking applications) depending on organizational
needs. Related controls: AC-17, CM-8, SC-7.
c. Software use within a SAP environment can make licensing difficult, but system specific
Chapter 3-CM PAGE 3-127
controls that are in place to ensure licensing is properly managed are required.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS | OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
The organization establishes the following restrictions on the use of open source software: [Assignment:
organization-defined restrictions].
Supplemental Guidance: Open source software refers to software that is available in source code form.
Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided under software
license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the software. From a security
perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it provides organizations with the
ability to examine the source code. However, there are also various licensing issues associated with
open source software including, for example, the constraints on derivative use of such software.
References: None.
CM-11 USER-INSTALLED SOFTWARE
Control: The organization:
a. Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined policies] governing the installation of software by
users;
b. Enforces software installation policies through [Assignment: organization-defined methods]; and
c. Monitors policy compliance at continuous monitoring interval.
Supplemental Guidance: If provided the necessary privileges, users have the ability to install software in
organizational information systems. To maintain control over the types of software installed, organizations
identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations
may include, for example, updates and security patches to existing software and downloading applications
from organization-approved “app stores.” Prohibited software installations may include, for example,
software with unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious.
The policies organizations select governing user-installed software may be organization-developed or
provided by some external entity. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods (e.g., periodic
examination of user accounts), automated methods (e.g., configuration settings implemented on
organizational information systems), or both. Related controls: AC-3, CM-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-7,
PL-4.
This control is not discussing the software approval process, only discussing who has
installation privileges. Generally, system administrators install software; however, on
systems where a user may be authorized to install identified approved software, e.g., from the
system’s online ‘app store.’
This control implementation is also related directly to the use of whitelisting of software that
is documented in CM-7 (5). If additional discussion of permissions for installation is
warranted for the system it can be documented here. Software approval procedures are
outlined in CM-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) USER-INSTALLED SOFTWARE | ALERTS FOR UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATIONS
The information system alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] when the unauthorized
installation of software is detected.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.
USER-INSTALLED SOFTWARE | PROHIBIT INSTALLATION WITHOUT PRIVILEGED STATUS
The information system prohibits user installation of software without explicit privileged status.
Supplemental Guidance: Privileged status can be obtained, for example, by serving in the role of system
administrator. Related control: AC-6.

FAMILY: CONTINGENCY PLANNING
Information system contingency planning refers to a coordinated strategy involving plans,
procedures, and technical measures that enable the recovery of information systems, operations, and
data after a disruption. Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the following
approaches to restore disrupted services:
• Restoring information systems using alternate equipment.
• Performing some or all of the affected business processes using alternate processing
(manual) means (typically acceptable for only short-term disruptions).
• Recovering information systems operations at an alternate location (typically acceptable for
only long–term disruptions or those physically impacting the facility).
• Implementing appropriate contingency planning controls based on the information system’s
security impact level.
Information system contingency planning represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain
and recover critical system services following an emergency event. Information system contingency
planning fits into a much broader security and emergency management effort that includes
organizational and business process continuity, disaster recovery planning, and incident management.
Ultimately, organizations use a suite of plans to properly prepare response, recovery, and continuity
activities for disruptions affecting the organization’s information systems, mission/business
functions, personnel, and the facility. Because there is an inherent relationship between an
information system and the mission/business process it supports, there must be coordination between
each plan during development and updates to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources
neither negate each other nor duplicate efforts.
Continuity and contingency planning are critical components of emergency management and
organizational resilience but are often confused in their use. Continuity planning normally applies to
the mission/business itself; it concerns the ability to continue critical functions and processes during
and after an emergency event. Contingency planning normally applies to information systems, and
provides the steps needed to recover the operation of all or part of designated information systems at
an existing or new location in an emergency. Cyber Incident Response Planning is a type of plan that
normally focuses on detection, response, and recovery to a computer security incident or event.
In general, universally accepted definitions for information system contingency planning and the
related planning areas have not been available. Occasionally, this leads to confusion regarding the
actual scope and purpose of various types of plans. To provide a common basis of understanding
regarding information system contingency planning, this section identifies several other types of
plans and describes their purpose and scope relative to information system contingency planning.
Because of the lack of standard definitions for these types of plans, the scope of actual plans
developed by organizations may vary from the descriptions below. This guide applies the
descriptions and references in controls below to security and emergency management-related plans.
The plans listed are in alphabetical order, and do not imply any order of importance.
The focus of this Contingency Planning (CP) section is information system contingency planning.

CP-1 a. b. CONTINGENCY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. A contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and associated
contingency planning controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
1. Contingency planning policy at least annually; and
2. Contingency planning procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CP family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. CP-2 CONTINGENCY PLAN
Control: The organization:
Develops a contingency plan for the information system that:
1. Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency requirements;
2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-131
3. 4. 5. b. c. d. e. f. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information;
Addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite an information system
disruption, compromise, or failure;
Addresses eventual, full information system restoration without deterioration of the security
safeguards originally planned and implemented; and
6. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
Distributes copies of the contingency plan to key personnel or roles and organizational elements
identified in the contingency plan;
Coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;
Reviews the contingency plan for the information system at least annually;
Updates the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or
environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation,
execution, or testing;
Communicates contingency plan changes to key personnel and organizational elements identified
in the contingency plan; and
Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational
program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning
addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business
processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by
considering such planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing
contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of
achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for
organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of
continuity of operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system
availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission
and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of
information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful
degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and
operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency
planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency
planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident. Related controls: AC-14,
CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, IR-4, IR-8, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, PM-8, PM-11.
g. The availability impact level drives the level of contingency required for the system. The
Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP) may be either a separate document specific to
the IS, included in the SSP, or may be incorporated into a broader site contingency plan, such
as the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) or Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). ISCP
development is the responsibility of the ISO.
A key step in developing an ISCP is to conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA). The BIA
enables the organization to characterize the system components, supported mission/business
functions, and interdependencies. The BIA purpose is to correlate the system with the
critical mission/business processes and services provided, and based on that information,
characterize the consequences of a disruption. The organization can use the BIA results to
determine contingency planning requirements and priorities. Results from the BIA can also
be incorporated into the analysis and strategy development efforts for the organization’s
COOP, BCPs, and DRP. The depth of planning and degree of detail in an ISCP is dependent
on the mission criticality of each system should the system become unavailable. A simple
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-132
statement as to how long a system can remain unavailable before it impacts the mission is the
basic foundation of a BIA. The mission owner or ISO determine to what lengths the
ISSM/ISSO should go to ensure a contingency plan is in place, e.g., relocation of
users/team/crew, hot backup, warm backup, backup media stored offsite, no additional
measures beyond backing up the data.
The plan must define and describe specific responsibilities of designated staff or positions to
facilitate the recovery and/or continuity of essential system functions. The ISCP consists of a
comprehensive description of all actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster or
emergency condition along with documented and tested procedures. The ISCP helps to
ensure critical resources are available and facilitates the continuity of operations in an
emergency situation.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS
The organization coordinates contingency plan development with organizational elements responsible for related
plans.
Supplemental Guidance: Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information systems
include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations
Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans,
Insider Threat Implementation Plan, and Occupant Emergency Plans.
CONTINGENCY PLAN | CAPACITY PLANNING
The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing,
telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.
Supplemental Guidance: Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g., natural
disasters, targeted cyber attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing,
telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational
missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during
contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning.
CONTINGENCY PLAN | RESUME ESSENTIAL MISSIONS / BUSINESS FUNCTIONS
The organization plans for the resumption of essential missions and business functions within a time period as
defined in the contingency plan of contingency plan activation.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example,
as part of business impact analyses. The time period for resumption of essential missions/business
functions may be dependent on the severity/extent of disruptions to the information system and its
supporting infrastructure. Related control: PE-12.
CONTINGENCY PLAN | RESUME ALL MISSIONS / BUSINESS FUNCTIONS
The organization plans for the resumption of all missions and business functions within a time period as defined in
the contingency plan of contingency plan activation.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example,
as part of business impact analyses. The time period for resumption of all missions/business functions
may be dependent on the severity/extent of disruptions to the information system and its supporting
infrastructure. Related control: PE-12.
CONTINGENCY PLAN | CONTINUE ESSENTIAL MISSIONS / BUSINESS FUNCTIONS
The organization plans for the continuance of essential missions and business functions with little or no loss of
operational continuity and sustains that continuity until full information system restoration at primary processing
and/or storage sites.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example,
as part of business impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage sites defined by organizations
as part of contingency planning may change depending on the circumstances associated with the
contingency (e.g., backup sites may become primary sites). Related control: PE-12.
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-133
(6) CONTINGENCY PLAN | ALTERNATE PROCESSING / STORAGE SITE
The organization plans for the transfer of essential missions and business functions to alternate processing and/or
storage sites with little or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that continuity through information system
restoration to primary processing and/or storage sites.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example,
as part of business impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage sites defined by organizations
as part of contingency planning may change depending on the circumstances associated with the
contingency (e.g., backup sites may become primary sites). Related control: PE-12.
(7) CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS
The organization coordinates its contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service providers to ensure
that contingency requirements can be satisfied.
Supplemental Guidance: When the capability of an organization to successfully carry out its core
missions/business functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a timely and
comprehensive contingency plan may become more challenging. In this situation, organizations
coordinate contingency planning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans
reflect the overall contingency needs of the organization. Related control: SA-9.
(8) CONTINGENCY PLAN | IDENTIFY CRITICAL ASSETS
The organization identifies critical information system assets supporting essential missions and business functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example,
as part of business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical information system assets so that
additional safeguards and countermeasures can be employed (above and beyond those safeguards and
countermeasures routinely implemented) to help ensure that organizational missions/business functions
can continue to be conducted during contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical
information assets facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical information system
assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include, for example, information
technology services, information system components, information technology products, and
mechanisms. Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually executed operations) and
personnel (individuals operating technical safeguards and/or executing manual procedures).
Organizational program protection plans can provide assistance in identifying critical assets. Related
controls: SA-14, SA-15.

CP-3 CONTINGENCY TRAINING
a. b. c. Control: The organization provides contingency training to information system users consistent with
assigned roles and responsibilities:
Within ten (10) working days of assuming a contingency role or responsibility;
When required by information system changes; and
Annually or as defined in the contingency plan thereafter.
Supplemental Guidance: Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and
responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is
included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know when and where to report for
duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system administrators may
require additional training on how to set up information systems at alternate processing and storage sites;
and managers/senior leaders may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential
functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications with other governmental
entities for purposes of coordination on contingency-related activities. Training for contingency
roles/responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the contingency plan. Related controls:
AT-2, AT-3, CP-2, IR-2.
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-134
Simulated events should be incorporated in the training. For example, training might include
a scenario where a Category 3 hurricane (or similar natural/man-made potential disaster) is
bearing down on your location. This would be a simulated event which would provide a more
realistic training scenario.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) CONTINGENCY TRAINING | SIMULATED EVENTS
The organization incorporates simulated events into contingency training to facilitate effective response by personnel
in crisis situations.
CONTINGENCY TRAINING | AUTOMATED TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to provide a more thorough and realistic contingency training
environment.
References: Federal Continuity Directive 1; NIST Special Publications 800-16, 800-50.
a. b. c. CP-4 CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING
Control: The organization:
Tests the contingency plan for the information system annually using documented tests as defined in
the contingency plan to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to
execute the plan;
Reviews the contingency plan test results; and
Initiates corrective actions, if needed.
Supplemental Guidance: Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans
and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example, walk-through and tabletop exercises,
checklists, simulations (parallel, full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing
based on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on
organizational operations, assets, and individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have
flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions. Related controls: CP-2,
CP-3, IR-3.
Results of documented tests should be retained for previous two years and after action
reports should be maintained for the life of the system.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS
The organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related plans.
Supplemental Guidance: Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information systems
include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations
Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, and
Occupant Emergency Plans. This control enhancement does not require organizations to create
organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with specific plans. It does
require, however, that if such organizational elements are responsible for related plans, organizations
should coordinate with those elements. Related controls: IR-8, PM-8.
CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE
The organization tests the contingency plan at the alternate processing site:
(a) To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and
(b) To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency operations.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: CP-7.
CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | AUTOMATED TESTING
The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test the contingency plan.
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-135
(4) Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms provide more thorough and effective testing of
contingency plans, for example: (i) by providing more complete coverage of contingency issues; (ii) by
selecting more realistic test scenarios and environments; and (iii) by effectively stressing the
information system and supported missions.
CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING | FULL RECOVERY / RECONSTITUTION
The organization includes a full recovery and reconstitution of the information system to a known state as part of
contingency plan testing.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CP-10, SC-24.

a. b. CP-6 ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE
Control: The organization:
Establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to permit the storage and retrieval
of information system backup information; and
Ensures that the alternate storage site provides information security safeguards equivalent to that of the
primary site.
Supplemental Guidance: Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from primary storage
sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of information and data in the event that the
primary storage site is not available. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include, for
example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection
requirements, and coordination of delivery/retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the
requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential missions/business functions
despite disruption, compromise, or failure in organizational information systems. Related controls: CP-2,
CP-7, CP-9, CP-10, MP-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE
The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is separated from the primary storage site to reduce
susceptibility to the same threats.
Supplemental Guidance: Threats that affect alternate storage sites are typically defined in organizational
assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber attacks,
and errors of omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of
separation between primary and alternate storage sites based on the types of threats that are of concern.
For one particular type of threat (i.e., hostile cyber attack), the degree of separation between sites is
less relevant. Related control: RA-3.
ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | RECOVERY TIME / POINT OBJECTIVES
The organization configures the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in accordance with recovery
time and recovery point objectives.
ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | ACCESSIBILITY
The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event of an area-wide
disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such determinations made by
organizations based on organizational assessments of risk. Explicit mitigation actions include, for
example: (i) duplicating backup information at other alternate storage sites if access problems occur at
originally designated alternate sites; or (ii) planning for physical access to retrieve backup information
if electronic accessibility to the alternate site is disrupted. Related control: RA-3.
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-136

a. b. CP-7 ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE
Control: The organization:
Establishes an alternate processing site including necessary agreements to permit the transfer and
resumption of information system operations as defined in the contingency plan for essential
missions/business functions within a time period as defined in the contingency plan when the
primary processing capabilities are unavailable;
Ensures that equipment and supplies required to transfer and resume operations are available at the
alternate processing site or contracts are in place to support delivery to the site within the organization-
defined time period for transfer/resumption; and
Ensures that the alternate processing site provides information security safeguards equivalent to that of
the primary site.
Supplemental Guidance: Alternate processing sites are sites that are geographically distinct from primary
processing sites. An alternate processing site provides processing capability in the event that the primary
processing site is not available. Items covered by alternate processing site agreements include, for example,
environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection
requirements, and coordination for the transfer/assignment of personnel. Requirements are specifically
allocated to alternate processing sites that reflect the requirements in contingency plans to maintain
essential missions/business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in organizational
information systems. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, MA-6.
c. This control is likely to be tailored out if the system availability impact level is low.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE | SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE
The organization identifies an alternate processing site that is separated from the primary processing site to reduce
susceptibility to the same threats.
Supplemental Guidance: Threats that affect alternate processing sites are typically defined in
organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures,
hostile cyber attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered
a sufficient degree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on the types of
threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e., hostile cyber attack), the degree of
separation between sites is less relevant. Related control: RA-3.
ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE | ACCESSIBILITY
The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site in the event of an area-
wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such determinations made by
organizations based on organizational assessments of risk. Related control: RA-3.
ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE | PRIORITY OF SERVICE
The organization develops alternate processing site agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in
accordance with organizational availability requirements (including recovery time objectives).
Supplemental Guidance: Priority-of-service agreements refer to negotiated agreements with service
providers that ensure that organizations receive priority treatment consistent with their availability
requirements and the availability of information resources at the alternate processing site.
ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE | PREPARATION FOR USE
The organization prepares the alternate processing site so that the site is ready to be used as the operational site
supporting essential missions and business functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Site preparation includes, for example, establishing configuration settings for
information system components at the alternate processing site consistent with the requirements for
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-137
(5) (6) such settings at the primary site and ensuring that essential supplies and other logistical considerations
are in place. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.

CP-8 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Control: The organization establishes alternate telecommunications services including necessary agreements
to permit the resumption of information system operations as defined in the contingency plan] for
essential missions and business functions within a time period as defined in the contingency plan when
the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate processing or
storage sites.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to telecommunications services (data and voice) for primary
and alternate processing and storage sites. Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity
requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential missions/business functions despite the loss of
primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time periods for
primary/alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include, for example, additional
organizational or commercial ground-based circuits/lines or satellites in lieu of ground-based
communications. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when
entering into alternate telecommunications agreements. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, CP-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (b) (2) (3) (4) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PRIORITY OF SERVICE PROVISIONS
The organization:
(a) Develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service
provisions in accordance with organizational availability requirements (including recovery time objectives); and
Requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for national security
emergency preparedness in the event that the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are
provided by a common carrier.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consider the potential mission/business impact in situations
where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar priority-of-
service provisions.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE
The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single point of
failure with primary telecommunications services.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SEPARATION OF PRIMARY / ALTERNATE PROVIDERS
The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary
service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.
Supplemental Guidance: Threats that affect telecommunications services are typically defined in
organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures,
hostile cyber/physical attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations seek to reduce
common susceptibilities by, for example, minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications
service providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations may
consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can provide alternate
telecommunications services meeting the separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PROVIDER CONTINGENCY PLAN
The organization:
(a) Requires primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have contingency plans;
(b) Reviews provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational contingency requirements;
and
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-138
(c) Obtains evidence of contingency testing/training by providers [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
Supplemental Guidance: Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such
plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient evidence for
organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service providers may also
participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with the Department of Homeland
Security, state, and local governments. Organizations may use these types of activities to satisfy
evidentiary requirements related to service provider contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | ALTERNATE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE TESTING

(5) a. b. c. CP-9 INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP
Control: The organization:
Conducts backups of user-level information contained in the information system at least weekly or as
defined in the contingency plan;
Conducts backups of system-level information contained in the information system at least weekly or
as defined in the contingency plan;
Conducts backups of information system documentation including security-related documentation
when created, received, updated, or as defined in the contingency plan or at least annually; and
Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information at storage locations.
Supplemental Guidance: System-level information includes, for example, system-state information, operating
system and application software, and licenses. User-level information includes any information other than
system-level information. Mechanisms employed by organizations to protect the integrity of information
system backups include, for example, digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. Protection of system
backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this control. Information system backups reflect
the requirements in contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up
information. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, MP-4, MP-5, SC-13.
d. Besides preventing data loss, backups of information for archiving purposes allow for proper
on-line storage management.
The ISO shall develop backup plans for all information systems. Backup plans must be
coordinated with the ISSM/ISSO and included in the ISCP. Backup plans should consider
data-production rates and data-loss risks. The areas of risk that should be identified and
planned for include, but are not limited to: Loss of power.
• Loss of network connectivity.
• Loss or corruption of data.
• Facility disruptions, such as loss of air conditioning, fire, flooding, etc.
Backup procedures should reflect the risk from media loss. If a hard disk were damaged, lost
or contaminated in some way, the disk backups, coupled with periodic incremental backups
between full backups, would allow for the restoration of the data. “Active backups” should
be maintained for disks that contain often-used applications.
Backup information must be protected to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. Digital
signatures and cryptographic hashes can be employed to protect the integrity of information
system backups. Reference SC-13, Cryptographic Protection. An organizational assessment
of risk guides the use of encryption for protecting backup information. Reference SC-28,
Protection of Data at Rest.

The organization tests backup information at least monthly or as defined in the contingency plan to verify media
reliability and information integrity.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: CP-4.
INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP | TEST RESTORATION USING SAMPLING
The organization uses a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected information system functions as
part of contingency plan testing.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: CP-4.
INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP | SEPARATE STORAGE FOR CRITICAL INFORMATION
The organization stores backup copies of [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system software and
other security-related information] in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the
operational system.
Supplemental Guidance: Critical information system software includes, for example, operating systems,
cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection/prevention systems. Security-related
information includes, for example, organizational inventories of hardware, software, and firmware
components. Alternate storage sites typically serve as separate storage facilities for organizations.
Related controls: CM-2, CM-8.
INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP | PROTECTION FROM UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CP-9].
INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP | TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE
The organization transfers information system backup information to the alternate storage site [Assignment:
organization-defined time period and transfer rate consistent with the recovery time and recovery point objectives].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system backup information can be transferred to alternate storage
sites either electronically or by physical shipment of storage media.
INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP | REDUNDANT SECONDARY SYSTEM
The organization accomplishes information system backup by maintaining a redundant secondary system that is not
collocated with the primary system and that can be activated without loss of information or disruption to operations.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CP-7, CP-10.
INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
The organization enforces dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of [Assignment: organization-defined
backup information].
Supplemental Guidance: Dual authorization ensures that the deletion or destruction of backup
information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals carry out the task. Individuals
deleting/destroying backup information possess sufficient skills/expertise to determine if the proposed
deletion/destruction of backup information reflects organizational policies and procedures. Dual
authorization may also be known as two-person control. Related controls: AC-3, MP-2.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-34.
CP-10 INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION
Control: The organization provides for the recovery and reconstitution of the information system to a known
state after a disruption, compromise, or failure.
Supplemental Guidance: Recovery is executing information system contingency plan activities to restore
organizational missions/business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes
activities for returning organizational information systems to fully operational states. Recovery and
reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities, recovery point/time and reconstitution
objectives, and established organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements.
Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim information system capabilities that may have been
needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored information
system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, potential information system
reauthorizations, and activities to prepare the systems against future disruptions, compromises, or failures.
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-140
Recovery/reconstitution capabilities employed by organizations can include both automated mechanisms
and manual procedures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-6, CA-7, CP-2, CP-6, CP-7, CP-9, SC-24.

INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION | TRANSACTION RECOVERY
The information system implements transaction recovery for systems that are transaction-based.
Supplemental Guidance: Transaction-based information systems include, for example, database
management systems and transaction processing systems. Mechanisms supporting transaction recovery
include, for example, transaction rollback and transaction journaling.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-13].
INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION | COMPONENT PROTECTION
The organization protects backup and restoration hardware, firmware, and software.
Supplemental Guidance: Protection of backup and restoration hardware, firmware, and software
components includes both physical and technical safeguards. Backup and restoration software
includes, for example, router tables, compilers, and other security-relevant system software. Related
controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.

CP-11 ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS
Control: The information system provides the capability to employ alternate communications protocols as
defined in the contingency plan in support of maintaining continuity of operations.
Supplemental Guidance: Contingency plans and the associated training and testing for those plans,
incorporate an alternate communications protocol capability as part of increasing the resilience of
organizational information systems. Alternate communications protocols include, for example, switching
from Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Version 4 to TCP/IP Version 6. Switching
communications protocols may affect software applications and therefore, the potential side effects of
introducing alternate communications protocols are analyzed prior to implementation.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
CP-12 SAFE MODE
Control: The information system, when [Assignment: organization-defined conditions] are detected, enters a
safe mode of operation with [Assignment: organization-defined restrictions of safe mode of operation].
Supplemental Guidance: For information systems supporting critical missions/business functions including,
for example, military operations and weapons systems, civilian space operations, nuclear power plant
operations, and air traffic control operations (especially real-time operational environments), organizations
may choose to identify certain conditions under which those systems revert to a predefined safe mode of
operation. The safe mode of operation, which can be activated automatically or manually, restricts the types
Chapter 3-CP PAGE 3-141
of activities or operations information systems could execute when those conditions are encountered.
Restriction includes, for example, allowing only certain functions that could be carried out under limited
power or with reduced communications bandwidth.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
CP-13 ALTERNATIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined alternative or supplemental security
mechanisms] for satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] when the primary means
of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised.
Supplemental Guidance: This control supports information system resiliency and contingency
planning/continuity of operations. To ensure mission/business continuity, organizations can implement
alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less effective than the primary
mechanisms (e.g., not as easy to use, not as scalable, or not as secure). However, having the capability to
readily employ these alternative/supplemental mechanisms enhances overall mission/business continuity
that might otherwise be adversely impacted if organizational operations had to be curtailed until the
primary means of implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to
provide such alternative capabilities, this control would typically be applied only to critical security
capabilities provided by information systems, system components, or information system services. For
example, an organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators one-time pads in case
multifactor tokens, the organization’s standard means for secure remote authentication, is compromised.

FAMILY: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
IA-1 a. 2. b. 1. 2. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. An identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and
associated identification and authentication controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Identification and authentication policy at least annually; and
Identification and authentication procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IA family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
Control Enhancements: None.

IA-2 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or processes
acting on behalf of organizational users).
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations deem to
have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers). This control applies to all
accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses
that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations
may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for
detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to
authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor authentication, or some combination thereof. Access
to organizational information systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is
any access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where
such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to
organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is
obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access
that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local
area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs)
for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled
endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and
integrity of information traversing the network.
Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying
with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific
organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-143
factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password,
personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device,
token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from
information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or
challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity
Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at
the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication
mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security.
Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8.
Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8.
Reference AC-2 Account Management for further guidance on the use of group accounts.
Control Enhancements:
(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged Accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.
Reference CYBERCOM Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 15-0102
Implementation and Reporting of PKI. ISOs should request AO guidance on CTO
implementation prior to acquisition of products as some systems will require Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) while multi-factor authentication for privileged users may be a more
appropriate solution for smaller systems.
(2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | LOCAL ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access to privileged accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | LOCAL ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS
The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access to non-privileged accounts.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | GROUP AUTHENTICATION
The organization requires individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator when a group authenticator
is employed.
Supplemental Guidance: Requiring individuals to use individual authenticators as a second level of
authentication helps organizations to mitigate the risk of using group authenticators.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - SEPARATE DEVICE
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts such that
one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access and the device meets
[Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - SEPARATE DEVICE
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts such
that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access and the device meets
[Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements].
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT
The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged
accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve
successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques
include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)
and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-144
(9) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT
The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to non-privileged
accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve
successful authentications by recording/replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant
techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.
(10) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | SINGLE SIGN-ON
The information system provides a single sign-on capability for [Assignment: organization-defined list of information
system accounts and services].
Supplemental Guidance: Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple
information system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by single
sign-on capabilities with the increased risk from disclosures of single authenticators providing access
to multiple system resources.
(11) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | REMOTE ACCESS - SEPARATE DEVICE
The information system implements multifactor authentication for remote access to privileged and non-privileged
accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access and the
device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: For remote access to privileged/non-privileged accounts, the purpose of
requiring a device that is separate from the information system gaining access for one of the factors
during multifactor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising authentication
credentials stored on the system. For example, adversaries deploying malicious code on organizational
information systems can potentially compromise such credentials resident on the system and
subsequently impersonate authorized users. Related control: AC-6.
(12) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to organizations implementing logical access
control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification
(PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201
and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11 requires federal agencies to continue
implementing the requirements specified in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials.
Related controls: AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.
PIV example: The DoD endpoint CAC is DoD’s version of a PIV card.
(13) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | OUT-OF-BAND AUTHENTICATION
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band authentication] under
[Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate
communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system. The first
path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices, and generally is the
path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is used to
independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example, a user authenticates via a
notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires access, and requests some action of the
server via that communication path. Subsequently, the server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone
to verify that the requested action originated from the user. The user may either confirm the intended
action to an individual on the telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type
of authentication can be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle
attacks. The conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat
indicators or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in
requested transactions. Related controls: IA-10, IA-11, SC-37.

Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-145
IA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates all types of devices before
establishing a network connection.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and
authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information systems
typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication
solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-
Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or
wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms by the
security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges of applying this control on large
scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices
that truly need to support this capability. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-3, IA-4, IA-5.
This includes, but is not limited to servers, workstations, multi-function machines, printers,
routers, scanners, firewalls, VoIP telephones, video and VoIP (VVOIP), desktop video
teleconference (VTC) devices, etc.
Control Enhancements:
(1) DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC BIDIRECTIONAL AUTHENTICATION
The information system authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined specific devices and/or types of devices]
before establishing [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection using bidirectional authentication
that is cryptographically based.
Supplemental Guidance: A local connection is any connection with a device communicating without the
use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a
network (e.g., local area or wide area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a
device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Bidirectional authentication
provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater
risk (e.g., remote connections). Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | DYNAMIC ADDRESS ALLOCATION
The organization:
(a) Standardizes dynamic address allocation lease information and the lease duration assigned to devices in
accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined lease information and lease duration]; and
(b) Audits lease information when assigned to a device.
Supplemental Guidance: DHCP-enabled clients obtaining leases for IP addresses from DHCP servers, is
a typical example of dynamic address allocation for devices. Related controls: AU-2, AU-3, AU-6,
AU-12.
DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | DEVICE ATTESTATION
The organization ensures that device identification and authentication based on attestation is handled by
[Assignment: organization-defined configuration management process].
Supplemental Guidance: Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a device
based on its configuration and known operating state. This might be determined via some
cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and authentication,
then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a configuration management
process such that the those patches/updates are done securely and at the same time do not disrupt the
identification and authentication to other devices.

a. b. c. d. e. IA-4 IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization manages information system identifiers by:
Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign an
individual, group, role, or device identifier;
Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;
Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;
Preventing reuse of identifiers for [the life of the system for individuals, groups, roles]; and
Disabling the identifier after [a period not to exceed 90 days of inactivity for individuals, groups,
or roles; not appropriate to define for device identifiers (e.g., media access control (MAC),
Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers)].
Supplemental Guidance: Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC),
Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is
not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically,
individual identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to those individuals.
In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This
control also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts
(e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to
information systems). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used
individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices. Related
controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, SC-37.
Individual user identifiers (USERIDs) are used for identification of users on SAP
information systems, which shall be standardized (e.g., last name first initial, first.lastname)
for each system. IA-2 addresses the use of unique identifiers.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | PROHIBIT ACCOUNT IDENTIFIERS AS PUBLIC IDENTIFIERS
The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers that are the same as public identifiers for
individual electronic mail accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Prohibiting the use of information systems account identifiers that are the same
as some public identifier such as the individual identifier section of an electronic mail address, makes
it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers on organizational information systems. Related
control: AT-2.
IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | SUPERVISOR AUTHORIZATION
The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier includes supervisor
authorization.
IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE FORMS OF CERTIFICATION
The organization requires multiple forms of certification of individual identification such as documentary evidence or a
combination of documents and biometrics be presented to the registration authority.
Supplemental Guidance: Requiring multiple forms of identification reduces the likelihood of individuals
using fraudulent identification to establish an identity, or at least increases the work factor of potential
adversaries.
IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IDENTIFY USER STATUS
The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as a contractor, government
(civilian, military), and/or foreign nationality as appropriate.
Supplemental Guidance: Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for example,
contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by specific characteristics
provides additional information about the people with whom organizational personnel are
communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to know that one of the
individuals on an email message is a contractor. Related control: AT-2.
Examples: john.smith.ctr, john.smith.civ, john.smith.uk
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-147
(5) (6) (7) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT
The information system dynamically manages identifiers.
Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume static
accounts for preregistered users, many distributed information systems including, for example, service-
oriented architectures, rely on establishing identifiers at run time for entities that were previously
unknown. In these situations, organizations anticipate and provision for the dynamic establishment of
identifiers. Preestablished trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate
identities and related credentials are essential. Related control: AC-16.
IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT
The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for cross-organization
management of identifiers.
Supplemental Guidance: Cross-organization identifier management provides the capability for
organizations to appropriately identify individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting cross-
organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information.
IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON REGISTRATION
The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier be conducted in person
before a designated registration authority.
Supplemental Guidance: In-person registration reduces the likelihood of fraudulent identifiers being
issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals and actual face-to-face interactions with
designated registration authorities.

a. b. c. d. e. f. g. IA-5 AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization manages information system authenticators by:
Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or
device receiving the authenticator;
Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;
Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for
lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;
Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;
Changing/refreshing authenticators within a time period not to exceed ninety (90) days for
passwords; system defined time period for other authenticator types;
Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect
authenticators; and
Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
Supplemental Guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI
certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as
opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases,
developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for
initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily
discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators
may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by
controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g.,
passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords
h. i. j. Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-148
accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator
management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics
including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time
synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example,
maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with
others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management
includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that
required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.

SC-28.
Passwords must meet standards for strong passwords. Examples of situations that may
require tailoring include, but are not limited to:
• The password mechanism does not support strong password requirements.
• The password is one factor of an authorized, multifactor authentication means.
• The password is used by a system process (as opposed to an interactive user session).
Shared (Group) Password [IA-5.a and .j]
An account password shared among a group of users (i.e., group account) shall be
specifically documented in the SSP and authorized for use by the AO or designee. If
specifically authorized, shared account passwords must not knowingly be the same for any
other account and shall be changed if a user leaves the group.

o At least eight (8) characters in length for non-privileged accounts and twelve (12) characters in length
for privileged accounts; contains a string of characters that does not include the user’s account name
or full name; includes one or more characters from at least three (3) of the following four ( 4) character
classes:
 English uppercase characters (A through Z);
 English lowercase characters (a through z);
 Base l0 digits (0 through 9); and
 Special characters from the punctuation and extended character set (`~!@#$%^*&()_+-
={}|[]\”;<>?,./).
Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: a minimum
of four (4) changed characters;
Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;
Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of at least one (1) day lifetime minimum and
90 day lifetime maximum;
Prohibits password reuse for a minimum of twenty-four (24) passwords generations; and
Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent
password.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals
using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords are
part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used
to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards). The implementation of
such password mechanisms may not meet all of the requirements in the enhancement.
Cryptographically-protected passwords include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and
one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number
of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. Password
(c) (d) (e) (f) Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-149
lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks
against passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords. Related control: IA-6.
These password requirements are for English display language. Other display languages
should use equivalent password strength requirements.
Passwords shall not be stored on an information system in clear text. An authorized,
non-reversible, encryption algorithm (e.g., hash algorithm) shall be used to transform a
password into a format that may be stored in a password file for use during subsequent
password-validation. Passwords and password files, when transmitted using electronic
means, shall be encrypted using an authorized algorithm.
An approved product vendor’s current password hashing algorithm is an authorized
algorithm when used on a protected network.
When possible, systems shall be configured to automatically notify the user of the
requirement to change their password at least fourteen (l4) days before its expiration.
The minimum age restriction does not apply to the initial change of a password, help
desk password reset, or when compromise of a password is known or suspected.
(2) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for PKI-based authentication:
(a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including
checking certificate status information;
(b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
(c) (d) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of inability to
access revocation information via the network.
Supplemental Guidance: Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate
revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, validation of certifications
involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust
anchor including certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.
Organizations shall ensure that remote sessions for accessing information systems
employ PKI certificates issued by a government-approved registration authority and are
audited. If PKI is not feasible, security measures above and beyond standard bulk or
session layer encryption shall be implemented (e.g., Secure Shell or VPN with blocking
mode enabled) [AC-17(7)].
(3) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION
The organization requires that the registration process to receive UserIDs and passwords be conducted in person
or by a trusted third party before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
The registration process to receive USERIDs and passwords should be carried out via
physical face-to-face or video and desktop teleconference, to the maximum extent
possible. The identity of a user receiving a password must be verified as part of initial
distribution of the password, using valid government identification (i.e., common access
card (CAC), driver’s license, or passport). Passwords issued shall be temporary and used
“one time,” expiring immediately upon log-in.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-150
For situations where face-to-face distribution is not feasible, due to location of the user in
relation to the distribution agent, system access credentials may also be disseminated
using one of the following methods identified below:
• Email to the user, via digitally signed and encrypted email using PKI, over a
network that meets or exceeds the classification level of the network to which
system access is being requested. Where PKI is not available, distribution via
email with a “read receipt” or acknowledgement of receipt of email from the
recipient is authorized as an acceptable alternative.
• Email to the supervisor or co-worker (when the supervisor is not available) via
digitally signed and encrypted email using PKI, over a network that meets or
exceeds the classification level of the network to which system access is being
requested. Where PKI is not available, distribution via email with a “read
receipt” or acknowledgement of receipt of email from the recipient is authorized
as an acceptable alternative.
• Secure telephone, after validating the employee’s personal information in the
appropriate database: name, USERID, date of birth and place of birth or other
agreed upon security questions. System access credentials disseminated via
secure telephone shall only be distributed over a network that meets or exceeds
the classification of the network to which system access is being requested.
The organization will define the process of how non-user entities are issued
authenticators as appropriate.
(4) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH DETERMINATION
The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy
requirements as defined in IA-5 (1).
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords and the
characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of which is carried
out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, RA-5.
Passwords should be sufficiently strong to resist “password cracking” and other types of
attacks intended to discover users’ passwords. Information resources should use
automated password filters to verify that passwords are created consistent with this
document. Automated tools should be accessible to assist users with checking password
strengths and generating passwords. A password cracking method shall be used only
with written AO authorization providing explicit direction for use during vulnerability
testing. Only authorized personnel will have access to and use password cracking tools.
Reference IA-5(1)(a) and (b) for password requirements.
(5) (6) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERY
The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide unique authenticators
or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to change
default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers and/or installers to
provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery
and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the developers of commercial off-the-shelve
information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in
acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring information systems or system
components.
AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS
The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of
the authenticator permits access.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-151
Supplemental Guidance: For information systems containing multiple security categories of information
without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators used to grant access
to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security category of information on the
systems.
Protect all authenticators (e.g., passwords, smart card personal identification numbers
(PIN)/passwords, PKI private certificates) from disclosure to entities other than the user,
system authentication components, and the authorized authenticator distribution entities.
Single factor authenticators shall be protected commensurate with the information
sensitivity accessible by the associated entity. Organization procedures shall implement
this protection. Users must take precautions when entering passwords to ensure that no
unauthorized individual observes their password keystrokes. Examples for protecting
individual authenticators are provided in IA-5 Supplemental Guidance above; the
requirement is implemented using PL-4 and/or PS-6. [IA-5.h]
(7) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | NO EMBEDDED UNENCRYPTED STATIC AUTHENTICATORS
The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or access scripts
or stored on function keys.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or stored
authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored,
then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators. This is irrespective of whether
that representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else (e.g., a password).
(8) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCOUNTS
The organization implements precautions including advising users that they must not use the same password
for any of the following: Different systems with domains of differing classification levels; Access to different
systems within one classification level (e.g., internal agency network and Intelink).; Different accounts with
different privilege levels (e.g., user, administrator) to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having
accounts on multiple information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems, there is the
risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other accounts if individuals
use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives include, for example: (i) having different
authenticators on all systems; (ii) employing some form of single sign-on mechanism; or (iii) including
some form of one-time passwords on all systems.
(9) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT
The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for cross-organization
management of credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: Cross-organization management of credentials provides the capability for
organizations to appropriately authenticate individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting
cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information.
(10) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION
The information system dynamically provisions identities.
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the
authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is established by
pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the information system. For example, the
binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) is accomplished by
provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the information system. New authentication
techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented outside an
information system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are
bound together on the card. Using these credentials, information systems can authenticate identities
that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these
situations, organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished trust
relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials
are essential.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-152
(11) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy [Assignment:
organization-defined token quality requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of PKI-based
tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card. Organizations define
specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a particular PKI.
(12) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for biometric-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy [Assignment:
organization-defined biometric quality requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Unlike password-based authentication which provides exact matches of user-
input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide such exact matches.
Depending upon the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism, there is likely to be some
divergence from the presented biometric and stored biometric which serves as the basis of comparison.
There will likely be both false positives and false negatives when making such comparisons. The rate
at which the false accept and false reject rates are equal is known as the crossover rate. Biometric
quality requirements include, for example, acceptable crossover rates, as that essentially reflects the
accuracy of the biometric.
(13) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | EXPIRATION OF CACHED AUTHENTICATORS
The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after one (1) hour.
AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | MANAGING CONTENT OF PKI TRUST STORES
The organization, for PKI-based authentication, employs a deliberate organization-wide methodology for managing
the content of PKI trust stores installed across all platforms including networks, operating systems, browsers, and
applications.
(15) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
The organization uses only FICAM-approved path discovery and validation products and services.
Supplemental Guidance: Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)-approved path
discovery and validation products and services are those products and services that have been approved
through the FICAM conformance program, where applicable.
References: OMB Memoranda 04-04, 11-11; FIPS Publication 201; NIST Special Publications 800-73,
800-63, 800-76, 800-78; FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance; Web: http://idmanagement.gov.
(14) IA-6 AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK
Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the authentication
process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.
Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from information systems does not provide information that would
allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of information
systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat
(often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or components, for
example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be less significant, and may need to be
balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore,
the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of
authentication information includes, for example, displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input
devices, or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it. Related control: PE-18.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
IA-7 CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE AUTHENTICATION
Control: The information system implements mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that
meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, and guidance for such authentication.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-153
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to
authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to assume the
requested role and perform services within that role. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules are often used to protect unclassified sensitive
information in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems).
Classified information systems use NSA-validated cryptographic modules.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: FIPS Publication 140; Web: http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/index.html.
IA-8 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or
processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).
Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizational users include information system users other than organizational
users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses
other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. In accordance with the E-
Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal
information systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with
exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations use risk assessments to determine
authentication needs and consider scalability, practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease
of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately
mitigate risk. IA-2 addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information
systems by organizational users. Related controls: AC-2, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MA-4,
RA-3, SA-12, SC-8.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS FROM OTHER AGENCIES
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other
federal agencies.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to logical access control systems (LACS) and
physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those
credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance
documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11 requires federal agencies to continue implementing the
requirements specified in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials. Related controls:
AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF THIRD-PARTY CREDENTIALS
The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement typically applies to organizational information
systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. Third-party
credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal government entities approved by the Federal
Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Trust Framework Solutions initiative.
Approved third-party credentials meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide
technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. This allows federal government
relying parties to trust such credentials at their approved assurance levels. Related control: AU-2.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | USE OF FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS
The organization employs only FICAM-approved information system components in [Assignment: organization-
defined information systems] to accept third-party credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement typically applies to information systems that are
accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. FICAM-approved information
system components include, for example, information technology products and software libraries that
have been approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management conformance
program. Related control: SA-4.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-154
In lieu of FICAM-approved products, DoD SAPs shall use DoD-approved products.
(4) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | USE OF FICAM-ISSUED PROFILES
The information system conforms to FICAM-issued profiles.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses open identity management standards. To
ensure that these standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable (e.g., available in commercial
information technology products), and interoperable as documented, the United States Government
assesses and scopes identity management standards and technology implementations against applicable
federal legislation, directives, policies, and requirements. The result is FICAM-issued implementation
profiles of approved protocols (e.g., FICAM authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID
2.0, as well as other protocols such as the FICAM Backend Attribute Exchange). Related control: SA-
4.
In lieu of FICAM-approved profiles, DoD SAPs shall use DoD-approved
implementations.
(5) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV-I CREDENTIALS
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification-I (PIV-I) credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement: (i) applies to logical and physical access control
systems; and (ii) addresses Non-Federal Issuers (NFIs) of identity cards that desire to interoperate with
United States Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) information systems and that can be
trusted by federal government-relying parties. The X.509 certificate policy for the Federal Bridge
Certification Authority (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements. The PIV-I card is suitable for
Assurance Level 4 as defined in OMB Memorandum 04-04 and NIST Special Publication 800-63, and
multifactor authentication as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-116. PIV-I credentials are those
credentials issued by a PIV-I provider whose PIV-I certificate policy maps to the Federal Bridge PIV-I
Certificate Policy. A PIV-I provider is cross-certified (directly or through another PKI bridge) with the
FBCA with policies that have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of the PIV-I
policies defined in the FBCA certificate policy. Related control: AU-2.

in Cyberspace; Web: http://idmanagement.gov.
IA-9 SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Control: The organization identifies and authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined information
system services] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: This control supports service-oriented architectures and other distributed
architectural approaches requiring the identification and authentication of information system services. In
such architectures, external services often appear dynamically. Therefore, information systems should be
able to determine in a dynamic manner, if external providers and associated services are authentic.
Safeguards implemented by organizational information systems to validate provider and service
authenticity include, for example, information or code signing, provenance graphs, and/or electronic
signatures indicating or including the sources of services.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | INFORMATION EXCHANGE
The organization ensures that service providers receive, validate, and transmit identification and authentication
information.
SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | TRANSMISSION OF DECISIONS
The organization ensures that identification and authentication decisions are transmitted between [Assignment:
organization-defined services] consistent with organizational policies.
Supplemental Guidance: For distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions
regarding the validation of identification and authentication claims may be made by services separate
from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide the
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-155
identification and authentication decisions (as opposed to the actual identifiers and authenticators) to
the services that need to act on those decisions. Related control: SC-8.
References: None.
IA-10 ADAPTIVE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Control: The organization requires that individuals accessing the information system employ [Assignment:
organization-defined supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms] under specific [Assignment:
organization-defined circumstances or situations].
Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and
subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially occur with any
authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this threat, organizations may employ
specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior (e.g., individuals
accessing information that they do not typically access as part of their normal duties, roles, or
responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals would routinely access, or
attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses). In these situations when certain
preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require selected individuals to provide
additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive identification and authentication is
to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed. Related
controls: AU-6, SI-4.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
IA-11 RE-AUTHENTICATION
Control: The organization requires users and devices to re-authenticate when [Assignment: organization-
defined circumstances or situations requiring re-authentication].
Supplemental Guidance: In addition to the re-authentication requirements associated with session locks,
organizations may require re-authentication of individuals and/or devices in other situations including, for
example: (i) when authenticators change; (ii), when roles change; (iii) when security categories of
information systems change; (iv), when the execution of privileged functions occurs; (v) after a fixed
period of time; or (vi) periodically. Related control: AC-11.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
Chapter 3-IA PAGE 3-156
FAMILY: INCIDENT RESPONSE
This section comprises the incident response controls for the DoD SAP Community and for all
information systems under the purview of the cognizant SAP AO. When establishing an incident
response program, policy, plan, and procedures; consider starting with the most likely incident to
occur on your system. For most sites, this is a data spill. Once the basic procedures for training,
testing, handling, monitoring, and reporting for one type of incident (e.g., data spill) are documented,
the process is more easily expanded to encompass other potential incidents. Addressing Incident
Handling (IR-4) for different types of incidents will likely require the most updates/changes.
Definitions commonly used in Incident Response include:
• Event - Any observable occurrence in a system and/or network. [CNSSI 4009]
• Incident - An occurrence that results in actual or potential jeopardy to the confidentially,
integrity or availability of an information system or the information the system processes,
stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security
policies, security procedures or acceptable use policies. See cyber incident. See also event,
security-relevant, and intrusion. [CNSSI 4009]
• Cyber incident – Actions taken through the use of an information system or network that
result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system, network, and/or the
information residing therein. [CNSSI 4009]
• Data spill or Spillage - Security incident that results in the transfer of classified information
onto an information system not authorized to store or process that information. [CNSSI
4009] Also referred to as exfiltration – the unauthorized transfer of data from a system.
[CNSSI 4009]
IR-1 a. 2. b. INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. An incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and associated incident
response controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Incident response policy at least annually; and
Incident response procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP specific policy and procedures related to incident response are defined in the
remainder of this section. Background information as it applies to incident response is
provided throughout this section.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-157
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-12, 800-61, 800-83, 800-100.
IR-2 INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING
a. b. Control: The organization provides incident response training to information system users consistent with
assigned roles and responsibilities:
Within thirty (30) working days of assuming an incident response role or responsibility;
When required by information system changes; and
c. At least annually thereafter.
Supplemental Guidance: Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles
and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is
included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to
recognize an incident on the information system; system administrators may require additional training on
how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on
forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in
the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal sources. Related
controls: AT-3, CP-3, IR-8.
Incident recognition and reporting training shall be included as part of both general and
privileged user awareness training. See also Security Training [AT-3].
General users must be trained on what constitutes suspicious activity as it applies to the
system, other users, and unauthorized individuals internal and external to the organization.
General users must also know to whom and when to report suspicious activity and to keep
discussions about potential incidents within the incident response chain of command.
Privileged users should be trained in preserving the scene, preserving the data (volatile and
nonvolatile), chain of custody, and reporting requirements. Privileged users frequently move
from the containment phase to eradication compromising data necessary in prosecuting a
potentially criminal case. Privileged users must also know who to contact for assistance in
responding to an incident, e.g., the organizations IA point of contact. Additional incident
response related training may be required depending on the system, environment, and
mission criticality.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING | SIMULATED EVENTS
The organization incorporates simulated events into incident response training to facilitate effective response by
personnel in crisis situations.
Emphasis is on simulated, e.g., table top exercises, hot-wash, lessons learned. Use of
‘live’ data (e.g., ‘controlled viruses’) must have prior approval by the AO.
(2) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING | AUTOMATED TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to provide a more thorough and realistic incident response
training environment.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-16, 800-50.
IR-3 INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING
Control: The organization tests the incident response capability for the information system [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests] to determine the incident
response effectiveness and documents the results.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-158
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall
effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response
testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations
(parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a
determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities),
organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response. Related controls: CP-4, IR-8.
Lessons learned should be documented and incorporated into future exercises. If there were
no incidents during the past year, the incident response plan shall be tested using a simulated
incident/event.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING | AUTOMATED TESTING
The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test the incident response
capability.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively
test incident response capabilities, for example: (i) by providing more complete coverage of incident
response issues; (ii) by selecting more realistic test scenarios and test environments; and (iii) by
stressing the response capability. Related control: AT-2.
INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING | COORDINATION WITH RELATED PLANS
The organization coordinates incident response testing with organizational elements responsible for related plans.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational plans related to incident response testing include, for example,
Business Continuity Plans, Contingency Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations
Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-84, 800-115.
a. b. c. IR-4 INCIDENT HANDLING
Control: The organization:
Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection
and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;
Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and
Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response
procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the
capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by
those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and
development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be
obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical
access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling
capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example,
mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,
physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and
the risk executive (function). Related controls: AU-6, CM-6, CP-2, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5,
SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.
Individuals involved in incident response, reporting and handling will treat each incident as a
potentially criminal case. IA professionals not trained in forensics and investigation should
ensure preservation of the scene and contact their IA forensics point of contact (POC) prior
to moving from the containment phase to the eradication phase to ensure preservation of data
(both volatile and nonvolatile) required for criminal prosecution. The NIST version of the
incident response lifecycle is depicted in Figure 3-1 below and described in NIST SP 800-61.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-159
Figure 3-1: Incident Response Life Cycle
Incidents are identified using the categories below, as indicated in CJSCM 6510.01B, Cyber
Incident handling Program, Table B-A-2.
In addition to selecting the appropriate category, also indicate if the incident resulted in a
data spill and/or unauthorized disclosure.
Category Description
1 Root Level Intrusion (Incident) - Unauthorized privileged access to an IS.
Privileged access, often referred to as administrative or root access, provides
unrestricted access to the IS. This category includes unauthorized access to
information or unauthorized access to account credentials that could be used to
perform administrative functions (e.g., domain administrator). If the IS
compromised with malicious code that provides remote interactive control, it
will be reported in this category.
2 User Level Intrusion (Incident) - Unauthorized non-privileged access to an IS.
Non-privileged access, often referred to as user-level access, provides restricted
access to the IS based on the privileges granted to the user. This includes
unauthorized access to information or unauthorized access to account credentials
that could be used to perform user functions such as accessing Web applications,
Web portals, or other similar information resources. If the IS is compromised
with malicious code that provides remote interactive control, it will be reported
in this category.
3 Unsuccessful Activity Attempt (Event) - Deliberate attempts to gain
unauthorized access to an IS that are defeated by normal defensive mechanisms.
Attacker fails to gain access to the IS (i.e., attacker attempts valid or potentially
valid username and password combinations) and the activity cannot be
characterized as exploratory scanning. Reporting of these events is critical for
the gathering of useful effects-based metrics for commanders.
Note the above CAT 3 explanation does not cover the “run-of-the-mill” virus
that is defeated/deleted by AV software. “Run-of-the-mill” viruses that are
defeated/deleted by AV software are not reportable events or incidents and
should not be not be annotated in JIMS.
4 Denial of Service (Incident) - Activity that denies, degrades or disrupts normal
functionality of an IS or DoD information network.
5 Non-Compliance Activity (Event) - Activity that potentially exposes IS to
increased risk as a result of the action or inaction of authorized users. This
includes administrative and user actions such as failure to apply security patches,
connections across security domains, installation of vulnerable applications, and
other breaches of existing DOD policy. Reporting of these events is critical for
the gathering of useful effects-based metrics for commanders.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-160
6 Reconnaissance (Event) - Activity that seeks to gather information used to
characterize IS, applications, networks, and users that may be useful in
formulating an attack. This includes activity such as mapping DOD networks, IS
devices and applications, interconnectivity, and their users or reporting structure.
This activity does not directly result in a compromise.
7 Malicious Logic (Incident) - Installation of software designed and/or deployed
by adversaries with malicious intentions for the purpose of gaining access to
resources or information without the consent or knowledge of the user. This
only includes malicious code that does not provide remote interactive control of
the compromised IS. Malicious code that has allowed interactive access should
be categorized as Category 1 or Category 2 incidents, not Category 7.
Interactive active access may include automated tools that establish an open
channel of communications to and/or from an IS.
8 Investigating (Event) - Events that are potentially malicious or anomalous
activity deemed suspicious and warrant, or are undergoing, further review. No
event will be closed out as a Category 8. Category 8 will be re-categorized to
appropriate Category 1-7 or 9 prior to closure.
9 Explained Anomaly (Event) - Suspicious events that after further investigation
are determined to be non-malicious activity and do not fit the criteria for any
other categories. This includes events such as IS malfunctions and false alarms.
When reporting these events, the reason for which it cannot be otherwise
categorized must be clearly specified.
Table 3-3: Cyber Incident and Reportable Cyber Event Categories
The terms used above aid in tracking trends. In rare instances when an incident may need to
be reported (reference IR-6) outside of the DoD SAP Community, the CA SAPCO and AO
will determine the appropriate category and channel for reporting. CA SAPCOs, for
instance, may use a specific reporting process and terms to better address incidents in their
community. An Incident or Reportable Event Category is a collection of events or incidents
sharing a common underlying cause for which an incident or event is reported. Each event or
incident is associated with one or more categories as part of the incident handling process.
Event 5 Sub-categories:
a. Unmarked IS Components - Unmarked IS components or media that place classified data
at risk.
b. Unattended IS Components - Discovery of unlocked active session without user present.
c. Unauthorized Software (not malicious) - Software obtained through unofficial channels
and installed without proper approval.
d. Other ________
Event 6 Sub-category:
Unauthorized Monitoring - Any monitoring of an IS without written approval from legal or
security authorities.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INCIDENT HANDLING | AUTOMATED INCIDENT HANDLING PROCESSES
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms supporting incident handling processes include, for
example, online incident management systems.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-161
(2) (3) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION
The organization includes dynamic reconfiguration of [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components] as part of the incident response capability.
Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic reconfiguration includes, for example, changes to router rules, access
control lists, intrusion detection/prevention system parameters, and filter rules for firewalls and
gateways. Organizations perform dynamic reconfiguration of information systems, for example, to stop
attacks, to misdirect attackers, and to isolate components of systems, thus limiting the extent of the
damage from breaches or compromises. Organizations include time frames for achieving the
reconfiguration of information systems in the definition of the reconfiguration capability, considering
the potential need for rapid response in order to effectively address sophisticated cyber threats. Related
controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-16, CM-2, CM-3, CM-4.
INCIDENT HANDLING | CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS
The organization identifies classes/categories as defined in CJCSM 6510.01B and [Assignment: organization-
defined actions to take in response to classes of incidents] to ensure continuation of organizational missions and
business functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to
design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious
attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include, for example, graceful degradation, information
system shutdown, fall back to manual mode/alternative technology whereby the system operates
differently, employing deceptive measures, alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is
reserved solely for when systems are under attack.
A database or spreadsheet may be used to capture information about each incident. This
method provides the opportunity to identify the class of each incident to ensure
appropriate actions are captured in the updated incident handling procedures.
(4) INCIDENT HANDLING | INFORMATION CORRELATION
The organization correlates incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an organization-wide
perspective on incident awareness and response.
Supplemental Guidance: Sometimes the nature of a threat event, for example, a hostile cyber attack, is
such that it can only be observed by bringing together information from different sources including
various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations.
Information correlation also provides an automated approach to track trends, i.e.,
individuals, specific systems, equipment resulting in updated overall training or
individual one-on-one recalibration, insight into system or equipment issues that call for
closer scrutiny. Including facility and room alarms in the database or spreadsheet can
also highlight recurring issues with an alarm on a particular facility or room. Larger
corporations should capture all incidents (system and environment) across campus to
better assess organization-wide trends, e.g., individuals, equipment. The sum total offers
an organization-wide awareness.
(5) (6) (7) INCIDENT HANDLING | AUTOMATIC DISABLING OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
The organization implements a configurable capability to automatically disable the information system if [Assignment:
organization-defined security violations] are detected.
INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES
The organization implements incident handling capability for insider threats.
Supplemental Guidance: While many organizations address insider threat incidents as an inherent part of
their organizational incident response capability, this control enhancement provides additional
emphasis on this type of threat and the need for specific incident handling capabilities (as defined
within organizations) to provide appropriate and timely responses.
INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - INTRA-ORGANIZATION COORDINATION
The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across [Assignment: organization-
defined components or elements of the organization].
Supplemental Guidance: Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation, detection
and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close coordination among a variety of
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-162
(8) organizational components or elements to be effective. These components or elements include, for
example, mission/business owners, information system owners, human resources offices, procurement
offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations personnel, and risk executive (function). In
addition, organizations may require external support from federal, state, and local law enforcement
agencies.
INCIDENT HANDLING | CORRELATION WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS
The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to correlate and share
[Assignment: organization-defined incident information] to achieve a cross-organization perspective on incident
awareness and more effective incident responses.
Supplemental Guidance: The coordination of incident information with external organizations including,
for example, mission/business partners, military/coalition partners, customers, and multitiered
developers, can provide significant benefits. Cross-organizational coordination with respect to incident
handling can serve as an important risk management capability. This capability allows organizations to
leverage critical information from a variety of sources to effectively respond to information security-
related incidents potentially affecting the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.
Incidents on SAP systems stay within SAP channels up through the SAPCO for external
release. Incidents of SAP data spilled to non-SAP systems require PSO and AO
notification prior to notifications outside of SAP channels.
(9) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RESPONSE CAPABILITY
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined dynamic response capabilities] to effectively respond to
security incidents.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the deployment of replacement or new
capabilities in a timely manner in response to security incidents (e.g., adversary actions during hostile
cyber attacks). This includes capabilities implemented at the mission/business process level (e.g.,
activating alternative mission/business processes) and at the information system level. Related control:
CP-10.
(10) INCIDENT HANDLING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION
The organization coordinates incident handling activities involving supply chain events with other organizations
involved in the supply chain.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations involved in supply chain activities include, for example,
system/product developers, integrators, manufacturers, packagers, assemblers, distributors, vendors,
and resellers. Supply chain incidents include, for example, compromises/breaches involving
information system components, information technology products, development processes or
personnel, and distribution processes or warehousing facilities.
References: Executive Order 13587; NIST Special Publication 800-61.
IR-5 INCIDENT MONITORING
Control: The organization tracks and documents information system security incidents.
Supplemental Guidance: Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example,
maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information
necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be
obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, incident reports, incident response teams, audit
monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports. Related
controls: AU-6, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.
Collecting user statements of those involved in incidents with SAP information systems is
also required in order to completely document the details of an incident.
While it is not cost effective for most organizations to maintain an online incident
management system, there are functions that can be automated to support the incident
handling process. For instance mechanisms in support of identification or detection and
analysis include:
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-163
• System audit logs that capture unsuccessful attempts to log into the system, attempts
to gain access to unauthorized folders/files, attempts to introduce unauthorized
software or media.
• Device audit logs.
• IDS, content filtering applications, etc.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INCIDENT MONITORING | AUTOMATED TRACKING / DATA COLLECTION / ANALYSIS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to assist in the tracking of security incidents and in the collection
and analysis of incident information.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms for tracking security incidents and collecting/analyzing
incident information include, for example, the Einstein network monitoring device and monitoring
online Computer Incident Response Centers (CIRCs) or other electronic databases of incidents.
Related controls: AU-7, IR-4.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-61.
a. b. IR-6 INCIDENT REPORTING
Control: The organization:
Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response
capability within 24 hours if not otherwise defined in formal organizational policy; and
Reports security incident information to the appropriate SAP Agency CIRT/CERT (see IR-4(8)).
Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements
within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and their
subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious
email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported,
the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal
laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy
requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements) report security
incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time
frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling.
Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, IR-8.
In the case of a suspected incident, containment procedures must begin immediately.
However, PSO/GSSO/CPSO confirmation of the classification of the information spilled is
required promptly so decisions concerning scale of containment and eradication efforts can
be scoped, e.g., SAP data spilled onto another SAP system tends to be (although not always)
less critical than SAP data spilled to an unclassified system.
The ISSM/ISSO is responsible for reporting incidents to security as well as to the AO, e.g.,
the ISSM/ISSO reports to the GSSO/CPSO, who in turn reports to the PSO and the PSO to
the Director of Security and/or CA SAPCO. The ISSM/ISSO must also report the incident to
the system DAO who in turn reports it to the AO and/or CA SAPCO. [IR-6.b] If an activity
from another organization is involved, the PSO or Director of Security will provide proper
notification to the organization.
Incidents in progress are classified a minimum of UNCLASSIFIED//Handle via Special
Access Channels Only (U//HVSACO). The PSO should be notified via secure
communications as soon as an incident has occurred or is in progress. Initial/interim
reporting should begin as soon as possible after knowledge of the incident and should
continue until the incident is resolved.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-164
Organizations will continue to report until the incident is closed. The CA SAPCO, Director
of Security, and AO will determine follow-on actions.
Information system-related fraud, waste, and abuse issues should be reported to the PSO,
ISO and/or ISSM/ISSO and dealt with by the organization’s chain of command. Individuals
also have the right to call the Fraud, Waste and Abuse Center (FWAC) hotline.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INCIDENT REPORTING | AUTOMATED REPORTING
The organization employs automated mechanisms to assist in the reporting of security incidents.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: IR-7.
Differing types of automated mechanisms can meet the intent of IR-6(1) This mechanism
may be a web-based form that is populated by the ISSM/ISSO or SA alerting the
appropriate individuals, or an email process that includes a preset distribution group to
ensure all key individuals are alerted in the event of an incident, e.g., ISSM/ISSO,
GSSO/CPSO, PSO/Director of Security, Incident Response lead (e.g., SAPCO’s IA
POC), DAO, and AO. Where a web-based form or email distribution is used, the
responder should be cautious of the type of incident and the classification of information
in the incident description and the classification of the system being used.
(2) INCIDENT REPORTING | VULNERABILITIES RELATED TO INCIDENTS
The organization reports information system vulnerabilities associated with reported security incidents to
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Service/Agency SAPCOs should identify an entity to provide Computer Network
Defense (CND). PSOs and field reps would then report all incidents to the CND Service
Provider (CNDSP) for analysis and response determination, providing guidance to the
site as needed. This provides an organization-wide awareness of incidents, a broader
capability for identifying trends, and the potential to share information with other
organizations in the community.
(3) INCIDENT REPORTING | COORDINATION WITH SUPPLY CHAIN
The organization provides security incident information to other organizations involved in the supply chain for
information systems or information system components related to the incident.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations involved in supply chain activities include, for example,
system/product developers, integrators, manufacturers, packagers, assemblers, distributors, vendors,
and resellers. Supply chain incidents include, for example, compromises/breaches involving
information system components, information technology products, development processes or
personnel, and distribution processes or warehousing facilities. Organizations determine the
appropriate information to share considering the value gained from support by external organizations
with the potential for harm due to sensitive information being released to outside organizations of
perhaps questionable trustworthiness.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-61; Web: http://www.us-cert.gov.
IR-7 INCIDENT RESPONSE ASSISTANCE
Control: The organization provides an incident response support resource, integral to the organizational
incident response capability that offers advice and assistance to users of the information system for the
handling and reporting of security incidents.
Supplemental Guidance: Incident response support resources provided by organizations include, for example,
help desks, assistance groups, and access to forensics services, when required. Related controls: AT-2, IR-
4, IR-6, IR-8, SA-9.
If the ISSM/ISSO or SA is not trained in incident response and investigation commensurate
with the level of skill required for a system, the organization’s incident response plan and
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-165
procedures must reflect reach-back to their CA SAPCO IA POC for forensics support.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INCIDENT RESPONSE ASSISTANCE | AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION / SUPPORT
The organization employs automated mechanisms to increase the availability of incident response-related
information and support.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms can provide a push and/or pull capability for users to
obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals might have access to a website to query
the assistance capability, or conversely, the assistance capability may have the ability to proactively
send information to users (general distribution or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of
current response capabilities and support.
Automated mechanisms for incident response related information and support may be
employed through a website, database, or other automated means.
(2) INCIDENT RESPONSE ASSISTANCE | COORDINATION WITH EXTERNAL PROVIDERS
The organization:
(a) Establishes a direct, cooperative relationship between its incident response capability and external providers of
information system protection capability; and
(b) Identifies organizational incident response team members to the external providers.
Supplemental Guidance: External providers of information system protection capability include, for
example, the Computer Network Defense program within the U.S. Department of Defense. External
providers help to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to unauthorized activity within
organizational information systems and networks.
The external providers for information system protection are the CA SAPCO IA POCs.
ISSM/ISSOs will provide local incident response team POCs to their CA SAPCO IA
POC. The names and contact information may be provided in the SSP.
References: None.
a. 4. IR-8 INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
Control: The organization:
Develops an incident response plan that:
1. Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability;
2. Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability;
3. Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall
organization;
Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and
functions;
5. Defines reportable incidents;
Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;
Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an
incident response capability; and
8. Is reviewed and approved by AO;
Distributes copies of the incident response plan to all personnel with a role or responsibility for
implementing the incident response plan;
Reviews the incident response plan at least annually (incorporating lessons learned from past
incidents);
6. 7. b. c. Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-166
d. e. f. Updates the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems encountered
during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
Communicates incident response plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined incident
response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; and
Protects the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Supplemental Guidance: It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to
incident response. Organizational missions, business functions, strategies, goals, and objectives for incident
response help to determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a comprehensive
incident response capability, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with
external organizations, including, for example, external service providers and organizations involved in the
supply chain for organizational information systems. Related controls: MP-2, MP-4, MP-5.
Ensure there is PSO coordination, as appropriate, on the Incident Response Plan and that all
incident response personnel who should receive a copy of the plan and any changes are
identified by name and/or role.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-61.
a. b. c. d. e. f. IR-9 INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE
Control: The organization responds to information spills by:
Identifying the specific information involved in the information system contamination;
Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the information spill using a method
of communication not associated with the spill;
Isolating the contaminated information system or system component;
Eradicating the information from the contaminated information system or component;
Identifying other information systems or system components that may have been subsequently
contaminated; and
Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions].
Supplemental Guidance: Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive
information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such
information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of lower
sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be of higher
sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational response is
generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or
classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific nature of contaminated
storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of individuals with authorized
access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the
fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of further
spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL
The organization assigns [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with responsibility for responding to
information spills.
INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | TRAINING
The organization provides information spillage response training annually.
Chapter 3-IR PAGE 3-167
(3) (4) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | POST-SPILL OPERATIONS
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined procedures] to ensure that organizational personnel
impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated systems are undergoing
corrective actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Correction actions for information systems contaminated due to information
spillages may be very time-consuming. During those periods, personnel may not have access to the
contaminated systems, which may potentially affect their ability to conduct organizational business.
INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | EXPOSURE TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] for personnel exposed to
information not within assigned access authorizations.
Supplemental Guidance: Security safeguards include, for example, making personnel exposed to spilled
information aware of the federal laws, directives, policies, and/or regulations regarding the information
and the restrictions imposed based on exposure to such information.
References: None.
IR-10 INTEGRATED INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSIS TEAM
Control: The organization establishes an integrated team of forensic/malicious code analysts, tool
developers, and real-time operations personnel.
Supplemental Guidance: Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information sharing.
Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and operators, to
leverage the team knowledge of the threat in order to implement defensive measures that will enable
organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid detection of intrusions,
development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example,
when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis team can rapidly develop an appropriate
response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and
augment ongoing intelligence development. This enables the team to identify adversary TTPs that are
linked to the operations tempo or to specific missions/business functions, and to define responsive actions
in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business operations. Ideally, information security analysis teams
are distributed within organizations to make the capability more resilient.
Control Enhancements: None.

FAMILY: MAINTENANCE
MA-1 a. 2. b. SYSTEM MAINTENANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
1. A system maintenance policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system maintenance policy and associated
system maintenance controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
System maintenance policy at least annually; and
System maintenance procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the MA family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to system maintenance are defined in the
remainder of this section.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-12, 800-100.
a. b. c. MA-2 CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE
Control: The organization:
Schedules, performs, documents, and reviews records of maintenance and repairs on information
system components in accordance with manufacturer or vendor specifications and/or organizational
requirements;
Approves and monitors all maintenance activities, whether performed on site or remotely and whether
the equipment is serviced on site or removed to another location;
Requires that [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] explicitly approve the removal of
the information system or system components from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or
repairs;
Sanitizes equipment to remove all information from associated media prior to removal from
organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs;
Checks all potentially impacted security controls to verify that the controls are still functioning
properly following maintenance or repair actions; and
Includes date and time of maintenance, name of the individual performing the maintenance,
name of escort (if necessary), a description of the type of maintenance performed, and a list of
equipment removed or replaced (including identification numbers, if applicable) in organizational
maintenance records.
d. e. f. Chapter 3-MA PAGE 3-169
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the information security aspects of the information system
maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including
applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, in-house, software
maintenance agreement). System maintenance also includes those components not directly associated with
information processing and/or data/information retention such as scanners, copiers, and printers.
Information necessary for creating effective maintenance records includes, for example: (i) date and time of
maintenance; (ii) name of individuals or group performing the maintenance; (iii) name of escort, if
necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance performed; and (v) information system
components/equipment removed or replaced (including identification numbers, if applicable). The level of
detail included in maintenance records can be informed by the security categories of organizational
information systems. Organizations consider supply chain issues associated with replacement components
for information systems. Related controls: CM-3, CM-4, MA-4, MP-6, PE-16, SA-12, SI-2.
IS are particularly vulnerable to security threats during maintenance activities. The level of
risk is directly associated with the maintenance person’s clearance and access status. A
maintenance person may be uncleared or may not be cleared to the level of classified
information contained on the IS. Properly cleared personnel working in the area must
maintain a high level of security awareness at all times during IS maintenance activities.
Reference MA-5(1) for escort requirements.
All maintenance activities should be performed on-site whenever possible. Removal of an IS
or system components from a facility for maintenance or repairs requires approval
coordination with the individual responsible for changes to the system, e.g., ISSM/ISSO and
the individual who approves removal of equipment from the facility, e.g., PSO/GSSO/CPSO.
[MA-2.c]
Any maintenance changes that impact the security of the system shall receive a configuration
management review and documentation update, as appropriate [MA-2.e]. See also [CM-3].
Organizations shall record all information system repairs and maintenance activity in a
maintenance log for the life of the IS and retain the log for a minimum of one (1) year after
equipment decommissioning or disposal.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE | RECORD CONTENT
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MA-2].
CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE | AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES
The organization:
(a) Employs automated mechanisms to schedule, conduct, and document maintenance and repairs; and
(b) Produces up-to date, accurate, and complete records of all maintenance and repair actions requested,
scheduled, in process, and completed.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CA-7, MA-3.
References: None.
MA-3 MAINTENANCE TOOLS
Control: The organization approves, controls, and monitors information system maintenance tools.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses security-related issues associated with maintenance tools
used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational information systems. Maintenance
tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items. Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for
transporting malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into
organizational information systems. Maintenance tools can include, for example, hardware/software
diagnostic test equipment and hardware/software packet sniffers. This control does not cover
hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the
Chapter 3-MA PAGE 3-170
system, for example, the software implementing “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software
implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch. Related controls: MA-2, MA-5, MP-6.
Devices with transmit capability (e.g., IR, RF) shall remain outside the facility unless
explicitly approved by the PSO and AO.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) MAINTENANCE TOOLS | INSPECT TOOLS
The organization inspects the maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel for improper or
unauthorized modifications.
Supplemental Guidance: If, upon inspection of maintenance tools, organizations determine that the tools
have been modified in an improper/unauthorized manner or contain malicious code, the incident is
handled consistent with organizational policies and procedures for incident handling. Related control:
SI-7.
MAINTENANCE TOOLS | INSPECT MEDIA
The organization checks media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are
used in the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance diagnostic and test
programs, organizations determine that the media contain malicious code, the incident is handled
consistent with organizational incident handling policies and procedures. Related control: SI-3.
MAINTENANCE TOOLS | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED REMOVAL
The organization prevents the unauthorized removal of maintenance equipment containing organizational
information by:
(a) Verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the equipment;
(b) Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;
(c) Retaining the equipment within the facility; or
(d) Obtaining an exemption from PSO/GSSO/CPSO and ISSM/ISSO explicitly authorizing removal of the
equipment from the facility.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational information includes all information specifically owned by
organizations and information provided to organizations in which organizations serve as information
stewards.
Media without write protection that is brought in for maintenance must remain within the
facility and must be stored and controlled at the classification level of the highest IS to
which the media was introduced. Prior to entering the facility, maintenance personnel
must be advised that they will not be allowed to remove media from the facility. If
deviation from this procedure is required under special circumstances, it must be
documented locally for review and approval by the PSO/GSSO/CPSO and ISSM/ISSO.
Each time the diagnostic test media is introduced into the facility it must undergo
stringent integrity checks (e.g., virus scanning, checksum) prior to being used on the IS,
and before leaving the facility, the media must be checked to assure that no classified
information has been written on it. See also MP-5.
(4) MAINTENANCE TOOLS | RESTRICTED TOOL USE
The information system restricts the use of maintenance tools to authorized personnel only.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to information systems that are used to carry
out maintenance functions. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-88.
MA-4 NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE
Control: The organization:
Approves and monitors nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;
a. Chapter 3-MA PAGE 3-171
b. c. d. e. Allows the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with organizational
policy and documented in the security plan for the information system;
Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;
Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.
Supplemental Guidance: Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by
individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal
network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals
physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating
across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance
and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication
requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong
authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password,
passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.
Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-2, MA-5, MP-6,
PL-2, SC-7, SC-10, SC-17.
Non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals
communicating through a network outside of the system’s authorization boundary. Non-
local includes devices shipped out for repair or online ‘remote’ maintenance.
Access shall be limited to those components of the information system being serviced.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (b) (2) (3) NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | AUDITING AND REVIEW
The organization:
(a) (AU-1); and
Audits nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions as defined in the organizations formal audit policy
Reviews the records of the maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.
NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | DOCUMENT NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE
The organization documents in the security plan for the information system, the policies and procedures for the
establishment and use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic connections.
NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | COMPARABLE SECURITY / SANITIZATION
The organization:
(a) Requires that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from an information system that
implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or
Removes the component to be serviced from the information system and prior to nonlocal maintenance or
diagnostic services, sanitizes the component (with regard to organizational information) before removal from
organizational facilities, and after the service is performed, inspects and sanitizes the component (with regard to
potentially malicious software) before reconnecting the component to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Comparable security capability on information systems, diagnostic tools, and
equipment providing maintenance services implies that the implemented security controls on those
systems, tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on the information system
being serviced. Related controls: MA-3, SA-12, SI-3, SI-7.
(b) If non-local maintenance is required from a service or organization that does not provide
the same level of security required for the IS being maintained, the system must be
sanitized (see the Media Protection (MP) section) and placed in a standalone
configuration prior to establishment of the remote connection. If the system cannot be
sanitized (e.g., due to a system crash), non-local maintenance is not permitted.
(4) NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | AUTHENTICATION / SEPARATION OF MAINTENANCE SESSIONS
The organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:
Chapter 3-MA PAGE 3-172
(a) (b) (5) (b) (6) (7) Employing [Assignment: organization-defined authenticators that are replay resistant]; and
Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the information system by either:
(1) Physically separated communications paths; or
(2) Logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-13.
NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | APPROVALS AND NOTIFICATIONS
The organization:
(a) Requires the approval of each nonlocal maintenance session by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
or roles]; and
Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the date and time of planned nonlocal
maintenance.
Supplemental Guidance: Notification may be performed by maintenance personnel. Approval of
nonlocal maintenance sessions is accomplished by organizational personnel with sufficient information
security and information system knowledge to determine the appropriateness of the proposed
maintenance.
NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal
maintenance and diagnostic communications.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: SC-8, SC-13.
NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | REMOTE DISCONNECT VERIFICATION
The information system implements remote disconnect verification at the termination of nonlocal maintenance and
diagnostic sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: Remote disconnect verification ensures that remote connections from nonlocal
maintenance sessions have been terminated and are no longer available for use. Related control: SC-

a. b. c. MA-5 MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL
Control: The organization:
Establishes a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintains a list of authorized
maintenance organizations or personnel;
Ensures that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the information system have required
access authorizations; and
Designates organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical competence to
supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access
authorizations.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software maintenance on
organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for individuals whose
maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff,
physical plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the
maintenance performed on the information systems while having required access authorizations refers to
maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance
personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants,
may require privileged access to organizational information systems, for example, when required to
conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk,
organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-
time use or for very limited time periods. Related controls: AC-2, IA-8, MP-2, PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, RA-3.
Control Enhancements:
Chapter 3-MA PAGE 3-173
(1) (2) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL | INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE ACCESS
The organization:
(a) Implements procedures for the use of maintenance personnel that lack appropriate security clearances or are
not U.S. citizens, that include the following requirements:
(1) Maintenance personnel who do not have needed access authorizations, clearances, or formal access
approvals are escorted and supervised during the performance of maintenance and diagnostic activities on
the information system by approved organizational personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate
access authorizations, and are technically qualified;
Prior to initiating maintenance or diagnostic activities by personnel who do not have needed access
authorizations, clearances or formal access approvals, all volatile information storage components within
the information system are sanitized and all nonvolatile storage media are removed or physically
disconnected from the system and secured; and
Develops and implements alternate security safeguards in the event an information system component cannot
be sanitized, removed, or disconnected from the system.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement denies individuals who lack appropriate security
clearances (i.e., individuals who do not possess security clearances or possess security clearances at a
lower level than required) or who are not U.S. citizens, visual and electronic access to any classified
information, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), or any other sensitive information contained
on organizational information systems. Procedures for the use of maintenance personnel can be
documented in security plans for the information systems. Related controls: MP-6, PL-2.
(b) If appropriately cleared personnel are unavailable to perform maintenance, an uncleared
or lower-cleared person may be employed provided a fully cleared, trained, and
technically qualified escort monitors and records their activities in a maintenance log.
(2) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL | SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS
The organization ensures that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on an information system
processing, storing, or transmitting classified information possess security clearances and formal access approvals
for at least the highest classification level and for all compartments of information on the system.
Appropriately cleared personnel who perform maintenance or diagnostics on IS do not
require an escort. Organizations are responsible for ensuring maintenance personnel are
familiar with organizational security procedures to assure the proper security procedures
are being followed.
(3) Supplemental Guidance: Related control: PS-3.
MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL | CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS
The organization ensures that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on an information system
processing, storing, or transmitting classified information are U.S. citizens.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: PS-3.
Outside the U.S., where U.S. citizens are not available to perform maintenance, foreign
nationals may be utilized, but only with PSO and AO approval. [MA-5(3)]
(4) (5) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL | FOREIGN NATIONALS
The organization ensures that:
(a) Cleared foreign nationals (i.e., foreign nationals with appropriate security clearances), are used to conduct
maintenance and diagnostic activities on classified information systems only when the systems are jointly
owned and operated by the United States and foreign allied governments, or owned and operated solely by
foreign allied governments; and
Approvals, consents, and detailed operational conditions regarding the use of foreign nationals to conduct
maintenance and diagnostic activities on classified information systems are fully documented within
Memoranda of Agreements.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: PS-3.
MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL | NONSYSTEM-RELATED MAINTENANCE
The organization ensures that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance activities not directly associated with
the information system but in the physical proximity of the system, have required access authorizations.
(b) Chapter 3-MA PAGE 3-174
Supplemental Guidance: Personnel performing maintenance activities in other capacities not directly
related to the information system include, for example, physical plant personnel and janitorial
personnel.
References: None.
MA-6 TIMELY MAINTENANCE
Control: The organization obtains maintenance support and/or spare parts for [Assignment: organization-
defined information system components] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of failure.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations specify the information system components that result in increased
risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation when the
functionality provided by those components is not operational. Organizational actions to obtain
maintenance support typically include having appropriate contracts in place. Related controls: CM-8, CP-2,
CP-7, SA-14, SA-15.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
The organization performs preventive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].
Supplemental Guidance: Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing of organizational
information systems components for the purpose of maintaining equipment and facilities in satisfactory
operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements,
adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur
or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to
avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve
and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they actually fail. Methods of
determining what preventive (or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example,
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of
codes, legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already
been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications.
TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE
The organization performs predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].
Supplemental Guidance: Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to evaluate
the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition
monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time
when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance
within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of
predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical
process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate.
Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby
minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial
cost savings and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the
item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing
technologies such as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection,
vibration analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.
TIMELY MAINTENANCE | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE
The organization employs automated mechanisms to transfer predictive maintenance data to a computerized
maintenance management system.
Supplemental Guidance: A computerized maintenance management system maintains a computer
database of information about the maintenance operations of organizations and automates processing
equipment condition data in order to trigger maintenance planning, execution, and reporting.

FAMILY: MEDIA PROTECTION
MP-1 a. 2. b. MEDIA PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A media protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and associated media
protection controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Media protection policy at least annually; and
Media protection procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the MP family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to media protection are defined in the
remainder of this section. Reference [SI-3] for scanning media for malicious code.
Government issued media may only be used in the performance of assigned duties; personal
use of government issued removable media is prohibited. Personally owned media are
prohibited on all information systems.
Media which is not write-protected and is placed into an IS must be protected at the highest
level of information on the system until reviewed and validated.

MP-2 MEDIA ACCESS
Control: The organization restricts access to all types of digital and/or non-digital media to [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives,
compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm.
Restricting non-digital media access includes, for example, denying access to patient medical records in a
community hospital unless the individuals seeking access to such records are authorized healthcare
providers. Restricting access to digital media includes, for example, limiting access to design specifications
stored on compact disks in the media library to the project leader and the individuals on the development
team. Related controls: AC-3, IA-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-3, PL-2.
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-176
The PSO/GSSO/CPSO provides security control measures for both digital and non-digital
media. However, the term media throughout the rest of this media protection section refers to
digital media as opposed to non-digital media (e.g., microfilm, paper).
All digital media, and the use of such media, must be authorized by the PSO, or designee,
prior to being introduced into the SAPF. Organizations are required to ensure the local
facility SOP defines personnel/roles and security measures used to control access to media
(i.e. centralized safe, media sign-out logs, media accountability logs, entry/exit procedures,
etc.). Maintain a list of authorized users and their respective authorized use privileges.
Personally-owned thumb drives, CDs, and DVDs are prohibited from entering SAP-
accredited facilities without PSO approval.

a. b. MP-3 MEDIA MARKING
Control: The organization:
Marks information system media indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats, and
applicable security markings (if any) of the information; and
Exempts new, unused, factory-sealed media from marking as long as the media remain within
[Assignment: organization-defined controlled areas].
Supplemental Guidance: The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable security
attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use of security attributes with regard to
internal data structures within information systems (see AC-16). Information system media includes both
digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes,
external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media
includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Security marking is generally not required for media
containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.
However, some organizations may require markings for public information indicating that the information
is publicly releasable. Marking of information system media reflects applicable federal laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related controls: AC-16, PL-2, RA-3.
Note that NIST makes a distinction between ‘security marking’ and ‘security labeling’ as
indicated in the supplemental guidance above.
All media will be marked in accordance with the current DoD SAPCO or Service’s specific
guidance. Reference DoDM 5205.07-V4, Enclosure 6, Marking IS Storage Media
Containing SAP Information.
All information storage media must be appropriately marked and protected to prevent the
loss of information through poor security procedures. Likewise, to prevent security
compromises, all output products (to include printed material) must be appropriately marked
and protected. Each user is ultimately responsible for the marking, handling, and storage of
media and paper products within their assigned area of responsibility.
In addition, security markings will be displayed on all servers, server cabinets,
desktops/laptops, removable/external hard drives, monitors and printers. Thin clients must
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-177
also be marked. In the case of multi-level devices the security marking shall reflect the
highest classification level authorized to be processed.
All IS storage media shall have external security markings clearly indicating the
classification and category (e.g., TS//SAR) of the information. All information storage
media will be marked with one Standard Form (SF) 700-series classification label or
approved substitute and one data descriptor label or approved substitute (e.g., spreadsheet
with media serial numbers and associated programs or equivalent information based on the
size of the media). [MP-3(a)]
An exception to the media marking requirement is new, unused, factory-sealed media. [MP-
3(b)]
Media marking labels are depicted below:

Data Descriptor Label
The SF 711, Data Descriptor Label, identifies the content of a specific piece of media. A SF
711 is not required if the media labeling contains all of the information included in the SF
711.
Media Label Placement
Labels will be affixed to all media in a manner that does not adversely affect operation of the
equipment in which the media is used. Labels may be trimmed to fit the media, or created
specifically for this purpose so long as the colors and usage are as specified for SF 700 series
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-178
labels. Additionally, media labels shall not cover the serial number of the device or account
control numbers. Labels made specifically for CD/DVDs may be applied directly to
CD/DVDs. All required information may also be written on the media with a paint-pen,
media label maker or permanent marker.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: FIPS Publication 199.
a. b. MP-4 MEDIA STORAGE
Control: The organization:
Physically controls and securely stores all digital media regardless of classification and/or non-
digital media containing classified information within an area and/or container approved for
processing and storing media based on the classification of the information contained within the
media; and
Protects information system media until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved
equipment, techniques, and procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact
disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically
controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories, ensuring procedures
are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining
accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet,
or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category and/or
classification of the information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which organizations
provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting
information and/or information systems. For media containing information determined by organizations to
be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on organizations
or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed. In these
situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection. Related controls: CP-6, CP-9, MP-2, MP-
7, PE-3.
All TS//SAR media shall be accounted for under the direct management of the Top Secret
Control Officer (TSCO). For information systems with a confidentiality impact level of
high, organizations shall encrypt or store off-line in a secure location information deemed to
be mission-critical program hard drives and/or backup media located within a closed storage
facility IAW local procedures. Program media and/or backup media located within closed
storage facilities shall be protected in accordance with local procedures. [AC-3(6)] If
encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the
cryptography used shall be Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS Pub
or FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (as amended), compliant.
The use of encryption by the organization reduces the probability of unauthorized disclosure
of information and can also detect unauthorized changes to information. Removing
information from online storage to offline storage eliminates the possibility of individuals
gaining unauthorized access via a network. See also SC-28.
Protection of Digital Media
As stated at the beginning of this section, CNSSI 4009 defines media as physical devices or
writing surfaces including magnetic, optical, memory chips, and printouts. This section
details the protection requirements for digital media which excludes paper and explains the
protection afforded digital media of varying classification levels.
(a) Accountability Systems. When securing classified digital media, a differentiation is
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-179
made between digital media that requires accountability, and that media which
requires control. Accountability is very costly to the government, and is typically
applied only to TS//SAR information, although on rare occasions, the Cognizant
Security Authority may mandate similar procedures for S//SAR programs within the
program’s SCG. An appointed TSCO tracks media under this category as part of the
facility Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Accountability controls include very
stringent tracking mechanisms and logs, tracking sheets which may require
signatures of those who handle the media, transmission, disposition and destruction
records, as well as annual inventories and account audits by a disinterested party.
Reference DoDM 5205.07-V1, Enclosure 5.
(b) Control Systems. S//SAR and below digital media does not require the same
stringent controls that are applied to accountability systems for TS although the
concern for its protection and usage within the SAP facility are just as important.
Unlike accountability, control systems and procedures require a tracking mechanism.
Reference DoDM 5205.07-V1, Enclosure 5.
(c) Commercial Software Protection. Commercial software maintained within the
facility by IT personnel and used to update systems or maintain proof of license or
purchase may be handled separately from the facility tracking log or system. This
media must be locked away in a separate container or cabinet and treated as
unclassified provided the write protection or verification of closed session was
verified by IT personnel once it was used in a classified computer system.
Commercial media still in shrink-wrap may remain this way and be secured in the
same cabinet as other commercial media.
(d) Factory Fresh Media. Factory-sealed media does not need to be controlled until
opened. Once opened, this media must be brought under control and stored within
the SAPF in a locked cabinet under the control of the Media Custodian. At no time
will any other users be permitted to have free access to blank media.
Removable Media Accountability
ISSM/ISSO shall:
• Determine which authorized use privileges a user may have for removable media
based on the user’s assigned duties.
• Ensure procedures are in place to address reporting a loss of removable media and
mitigating risk associated with the loss.
Each organization will audit information storage media accountability records for accuracy at
least annually or as specified by the AO. The results of these audits shall be documented in
an internal report to remain on file within the organization for at least one (1) year or one
review cycle whichever is longer. Organizations must be able to demonstrate positive
control and accounting of information storage media when reviewed by inspection
authorities. Discrepancies shall be reported to the ISSM/ISSO for further reporting to the
AO or designee, as required.
Control Enhancements:
(1) MEDIA STORAGE | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-28 (1)].
(2) MEDIA STORAGE | AUTOMATED RESTRICTED ACCESS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict access to media storage areas and to audit access
attempts and access granted.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms can include, for example, keypads on the external
entries to media storage areas. Related controls: AU-2, AU-9, AU-6, AU-12.

a. b. c. d. MP-5 MEDIA TRANSPORT
Control: The organization:
Protects and controls all types of digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled
areas using AO and PSO-approved security measures, to include courier and digital media
encryption;
Maintains accountability for information system media during transport outside of controlled areas;
Documents activities associated with the transport of information system media; and
Restricts the activities associated with the transport of information system media to authorized
personnel.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact
disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers),
that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations
provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting
information and/or information systems.
Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or classification
of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for
example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and
integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the
actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media
enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier
personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial
transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example,
restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of
transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss,
destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated
with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to
include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport
as part of an overall system of transport-related records. Related controls: AC-19, CP-9, MP-3, MP-4, RA-
3, SC-8, SC-13, SC-28.
PSO approved procedures shall be implemented to address mobile devices traveling to and
returning from a location that the organization deems to be of significant risk.
Information should be transmitted electronically whenever possible. When electronic
transmission is not possible, movement of all media shall be coordinated through the
appropriate personnel (ISSM/ISSO/GSSO/CPSO, etc.) following approved procedures. [MP-
5(a)]. All digital media storing data at rest shall be encrypted. [SC-28]
Activities associated with the transport of media shall be documented by the organization.
Appropriate entries in the organization’s media accounting system shall be made. [MP-5(b)]

(3) MEDIA TRANSPORT | CUSTODIANS
The organization employs an identified custodian during transport of information system media outside of controlled
areas.
Supplemental Guidance: Identified custodians provide organizations with specific points of contact
during the media transport process and facilitate individual accountability. Custodial responsibilities
can be transferred from one individual to another as long as an unambiguous custodian is identified at
all times.
Transport of media shall be restricted to an authorized custodian by means of a courier
card/letter.
(4) MEDIA TRANSPORT | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of
information stored on digital media during transport outside of controlled areas.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to both portable storage devices (e.g., USB
memory sticks, compact disks, digital video disks, external/removable hard disk drives) and mobile
devices with storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). Related control: MP-2.
Cryptographic mechanisms during transport outside of controlled areas shall be either
NSA approved or FIPS 140-2 compliant.

a. b. MP-6 MEDIA SANITIZATION
Control: The organization:
Sanitizes all digital and non-digital media prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or
release for reuse using IAW NSA/CSS PM 9-12 in accordance with applicable federal and
organizational standards and policies; and
Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security
category or classification of the information.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-digital,
subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include media
found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile
devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be
retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and
destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or
released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that
destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization.
Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for
media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have
no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-
digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified
document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted
sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA
standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information. Related
controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3, SC-4.
In addition to NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12, Storage Device Sanitization Manual (SDDM),
also reference the most current NSA/CSS Degausser Evaluated Products List (EPL) and
other NSA references located on NSA’s Media Destruction Guidance website:
https://www.nsa.gov/ia/mitigation_guidance/media_destruction_guidance/index.shtml.
Before storage media is released out of organizational control, becomes obsolete, or is no
longer usable or required for an information system, it is a requirement to ensure that residual
magnetic, optical, electrical, or other representations of data which have been deleted are not
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-182
recoverable.
• Sanitization is the process of removing information from storage devices or
equipment such that data recovery using any known technique or analysis is
prevented. Sanitization includes the removal of data from the storage device, as well
as the removal of all labels, markings, and activity logs.
• Destruction is the process of physically damaging media so that it is not usable and
there is no known method of retrieving the data. This may include degaussing,
incineration, shredding, grinding, embossing, chemical immersion, etc.
All sanitization and destruction procedures require AO approval, and must be in accordance
with the current version of the NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12. Organizations may also
institute additional media sanitization policies and procedures as needed.
Responsibilities
Organizations are responsible for ensuring adequate resources and equipment are available to
support media sanitization activities.
The GSSO/CPSO/ISSM is responsible for the security of all media assigned to the
organization and under his/her purview. To protect these assets, he/she must ensure the
security measures and policies contained within this section are followed. The GSSO/CPSO
shall develop media sanitization and removal procedures for PSO/AO approval. PSO/AO
reviews and approves media sanitization procedures and equipment (NSA approved) prior to
release/disposal or reuse of media.
Ensure appropriate safeguards are in place so removable media that contain classified,
sensitive, or controlled unclassified information are properly sanitized, destroyed, and/or
disposed of in accordance with an approved method when no longer needed.
Sanitization of Media
Prior to media disposal or release out of SAP control, organizations shall sanitize all media
using sanitization mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the
classification or sensitivity of the information.
All media, regardless of classification, shall be sanitized in accordance with Policy Manual
9-12 prior to release or disposal. Media may be reused within channels at the same level or
higher with an approved clearing process in place.
Degaussing Magnetic Media
Degaussers are ineffective in erasing optical and solid state storage devices.
Degaussing (i.e., demagnetizing) is a method of sanitization. Degaussing is a procedure that
reduces the magnetic flux on media virtually to zero by applying a reverse magnetizing field.
Properly applied, degaussing renders any previously stored data on magnetic media
unreadable and may be used in the sanitization process. Degaussing is not an approved
method for sanitizing optical media.
It is highly recommended that after degaussing, but prior to disposal, all media is physically
damaged to prevent data recovery attempts.
Refer to NSA’s website for media destruction guidance including the current Evaluated
Products List – Degausser. This Evaluated Products List (EPL) specifies the model
identification of current equipment units that were evaluated against and found to satisfy the
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-183
requirements for erasure of magnetic storage devices that retain sensitive or classified data.
Sanitizing Optical Media (Destruction)
Optical storage devices include CDs and DVDs. Optical storage devices cannot be sanitized,
only destroyed. Refer to Policy Manual 9-12 for detailed procedures related to the
sanitization of optical media. Equipment approved for use in the destruction of optical media
can be found in the NSA/CSS Evaluated Products List for Optical Media Destruction
Devices.
Sanitizing Solid State Storage Devices (Destruction)
Solid state storage devices include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory
(ROM), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), smart cards, and flash memory. Refer to
Policy Manual 9-12 for detailed procedures related to the destruction (e.g., smelting) of solid
state storage devices.
Release of Systems and Components
The ISSM/ISSO, in conjunction with the organization’s equipment custodian shall develop
equipment removal procedures for systems and components as approved by the AO. When
such equipment is no longer needed, it can be released if:
• It is inspected by the ISSM/ISSO. This inspection will assure that all media,
including all internal disks and nonvolatile memory components and boards, have
been removed or sanitized.
• A record is created of the equipment release indicating the procedure used for
sanitization and date of release to the equipment custodian. The record of release
shall be retained by the ISSM/ISSO for a period of two (2) years.
Release of Memory Components and Boards
A memory component is considered to be the Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU) in a hardware
device. Memory components reside on boards, modules, and subassemblies. A board can be
a module, or may consist of several modules and subassemblies. Memory components are
specifically handled as either volatile or nonvolatile, as described below.
Volatile Memory Components
Memory components that do not retain data after removal of all electrical power sources, and
when reinserted into a similarly configured system, are considered volatile memory
components. Volatile components that have contained extremely sensitive or classified
information may be released only in accordance with Policy Manual 9-12.
Nonvolatile Memory Components
Components that do retain data when all power sources are discontinued are nonvolatile
memory components. Some nonvolatile memory components (e.g., ROM, Programmable
ROM (PROM), or Erasable PROM (EPROM)) and their variants that have been programmed
at the vendor’s commercial manufacturing facility and are considered to be unalterable in the
field may be released. When in doubt, assume the component can be altered. All other
nonvolatile components (e.g., removable/non-removable hard disks) may be released after
successful completion of the sanitization procedures as defined in Policy Manual 9-12.
Other Nonvolatile Media
The following nonvolatile media could possibly retain data when all power sources are
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-184
discontinued.
• Visual Displays. There are many types of video display technologies in use. These
technologies are susceptible, to differing degrees, to a phenomenon called “burn-in”.
Burn-in occurs when the normally volatile components of the display mechanism
becomes worn or damaged and retain evidence of the data they were displaying. A
visual display may be considered sanitized if no sensitive or classified information is
remains in the visual display. If this information is visible on any part of the visual
display face, the display shall be sanitized before it is released from control.
The display technology in common use is liquid crystal display (LCD). When powered
for a long period in the rotated position a liquid crystal may retain some of its twist and
will not relax to its normal orientation. This is referred to as burn-in even though it is
physically twist-in. This burn-in is not typically a problem for LCD displays that do not
display an image for days on end. If LCD burn-in is suspected, the ISSO/SA shall
uniformly illuminate each pixel of the display then visually search for contrasting areas
that reveal information. Vary the intensity across the range of off to saturation for each
color (red, green, and blue).
LCDs with compromising burn-in areas identified during assessment can normally be
sanitized by leaving the device off for a few days in a warm (<140oF) environment until
the liquid crystals relax. If this insufficient then the display should be alternated between
long periods of full white and full black until the liquid crystals relax. If all this is
insufficient or the display is strongly suspect, then the liquid crystal medium in the
offending area of the display between the front and rear LCD plates must be disturbed or
removed. The liquid crystal medium is non-toxic but messy.
Actual burn-in can occur in legacy cathode ray tube (CRT), plasma, and laser phosphor
displays. Where bright images are displayed for long period of time in the same
location, the screen phosphors overheats and the image is permanently burned-in. The
ISSO/SA shall inspect the face of the visual display without power applied. If sensitive
information is visible (typically as a dark spot), the visual display shall be sanitized
before releasing it from control. If nothing is visible, the ISSO/SA shall apply power to
the visual display; then vary the intensity from low to high.
In accordance with NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12, CRT, plasma, and laser phosphor
displays visual displays exhibiting burn-in shall be sanitized by destroying the display
surface of the monitor into pieces no larger than five (5) centimeters square. Be aware
of the hazards associated with physical destruction of monitors.
LED displays (not LCDs with LED illumination) use an LED per pixel color and may
have burn-in when LEDs overheat and fail. LED displays are typically used in signage
and not on desktop displays. Destruction shall be sufficient to preclude the derivation of
sensitive or classified information from the arrangement of the inoperative LEDs.
• Printer Platens and Ribbons. Printer platens and ribbons shall be removed from all
printers before the equipment is released. One-time ribbons and inked ribbons shall be
destroyed as sensitive material. The rubber surface of platens shall be sanitized by
wiping the surface with alcohol.
• Laser Printer Drums, Belts, and Cartridges.
o Laser printer components containing light-sensitive elements (e.g., drums, belts,
and complete cartridges) shall be sanitized before release from control.
o Used toner cartridges from properly operating equipment that has completed a
full printing cycle (without interruption) may be treated, handled, stored and
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-185
disposed of as unclassified and may be recycled. When a laser printer does not
complete a printing cycle (e.g., a paper jam or power failure occurs), the toner
cartridge may NOT be treated as unclassified. If the toner cartridge is removed
without completing a print cycle, the cartridge drum must be inspected by lifting
the protective flap and viewing the exposed portion of the drum. If residual toner
is present, manually rotating the drum is sufficient to wipe off residual toner
material present. Alternatively, a subsequent print cycle may be completed and
is sufficient to wipe residual toner from the cartridge drum. After completing
sanitization actions, the toner cartridge may be treated, handled, stored, and
disposed of as unclassified (to include recycling).
• Multifunction Devices. Multifunction devices, including digital copiers and copier or
printer centers, have the capability to copy, print, scan, and fax, either in a standalone
mode or networked. These devices are computer-based, network-capable devices with
processors, memory, hard drives, image retention components, and, in some cases,
cellular phone transmitters with vendor auto-alert features. When using multifunctional
printer/copier equipment, the document image may remain on the imaging drum/belt,
hard drives, and static RAM. All memory resident components of multifunction devices
must be properly sanitized before release.
Destroying Media
Follow guidelines established in NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12. Media and memory
components that are damaged, malfunction, or become unusable must be destroyed using
methods appropriate for the media type.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) MEDIA SANITIZATION | REVIEW / APPROVE / TRACK / DOCUMENT / VERIFY
The organization reviews, approves, tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and disposal actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure compliance
with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for example, listing personnel
who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions, types of media sanitized, specific files
stored on the media, sanitization methods used, date and time of the sanitization actions, personnel
who performed the sanitization, verification actions taken, personnel who performed the verification,
and disposal action taken. Organizations verify that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to
disposal. Related control: SI-12.
MEDIA SANITIZATION | EQUIPMENT TESTING
The organization tests sanitization equipment and procedures at least annually to verify that the intended
sanitization is being achieved.
Supplemental Guidance: Testing of sanitization equipment and procedures may be conducted by
qualified and authorized external entities (e.g., other federal agencies or external service providers).
Note that NSA/CSS Degausser Evaluated Products List, dated February 1, 2015, and
subject to frequent updates states: “…customers should have their equipment re-tested
periodically according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.”
Example: Data Security, Inc. currently recommends that their degaussers be tested (aka
certified) every six (6) months for the first two (2) years of operation and then annually
thereafter. Testing may be accomplished using the Field CheckR, which requires the
user to maintain a log of the test results; or using a certified tape, which is returned to the
vendor, in this case Data Security, Inc. for results.
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-186
(3) MEDIA SANITIZATION | NONDESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES
The organization applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such
devices to the information system under the following circumstances: [Assignment: organization-defined
circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to digital media containing classified
information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage devices can be the source
of malicious code insertions into organizational information systems. Many of these devices are
obtained from unknown and potentially untrustworthy sources and may contain malicious code that
can be readily transferred to information systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While
scanning such storage devices is always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that
the devices are free of malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks.
Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices when such devices are
first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when organizations lose a
positive chain of custody for the devices. Related control: SI-3.
The use of nondestructive sanitization techniques (e.g., not destroying the hard drive) are
for initial sanitization of media prior to first use and not when the contents of the digital
media require retention.
(4) (5) (6) (7) MEDIA SANITIZATION | CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6].
MEDIA SANITIZATION | CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6].
MEDIA SANITIZATION | MEDIA DESTRUCTION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6].
MEDIA SANITIZATION | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
The organization enforces dual authorization for the sanitization of [Assignment: organization-defined information
system media].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that information system
media sanitization cannot occur unless two technically qualified individuals conduct the task.
Individuals sanitizing information system media possess sufficient skills/expertise to determine if the
proposed sanitization reflects applicable federal/organizational standards, policies, and procedures.
Dual authorization also helps to ensure that sanitization occurs as intended, both protecting against
errors and false claims of having performed the sanitization actions. Dual authorization may also be
known as two-person control. Related controls: AC-3, MP-2.
MEDIA SANITIZATION | REMOTE PURGING / WIPING OF INFORMATION
The organization provides the capability to purge/wipe information from [Assignment: organization-defined
information systems, system components, or devices] either remotely or under the following conditions: [Assignment:
organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects data/information on organizational
information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., mobile devices) if such systems,
components, or devices are obtained by unauthorized individuals. Remote purge/wipe commands
require strong authentication to mitigate the risk of unauthorized individuals purging/wiping the
system/component/device. The purge/wipe function can be implemented in a variety of ways
including, for example, by overwriting data/information multiple times or by destroying the key
necessary to decrypt encrypted data.

(8) MP-7 MEDIA USE
Control: The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of [Assignment: organization-defined
types of information system media] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system
components] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
Chapter 3-MP PAGE 3-187
Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives,
compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This
control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-
readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain
types of media on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or
external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies,
procedures, rules of behavior) to restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict
the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access
to certain external ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices.
Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for
example, devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage
devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage devices,
and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Related
controls: AC-19, PL-4.
Media use must be controlled at the end point as technically implemented in AC-6(1).
Media Reuse. Certain types of electronic media that have been previously classified under
one program may be reused by another program of the same classification level or higher
(e.g., S//ABC hard disk is transferred to S//XYZ, or S//ABC hard disk is transferred to
TS//LMNO). The individual types of media required for reuse must have specific procedures
documented and approved by the system AO. Best practices for wiping magnetic media or
SSD for reuse include: 1. One time overwrite utilizing a known pattern and an AO approved
product, and then verifying that the overwrite was successful utilizing a hex editor tool from
the first to last sector; or 2. Encrypt the whole media with an AO approved whole disk
encryption (WDE) tool and then destroy the key. For any media type the spirit of the
procedures must ensure any labels or evidence of the previous program has been removed
prior to handoff to the gaining ISSM or Security Officer.
Least Privilege [AC-6] and Separation of Duties [AC-5] are related controls and should be
enforced to the maximum extent possible to prevent unauthorized removal of information
from the system.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) MEDIA USE | PROHIBIT USE WITHOUT OWNER
The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such
devices have no identifiable owner.
Supplemental Guidance: Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for
portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to
assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g.,
malicious code insertion). Related control: PL-4.
MEDIA USE | PROHIBIT USE OF SANITIZATION-RESISTANT MEDIA
The organization prohibits the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: Sanitation-resistance applies to the capability to purge information from media.
Certain types of media do not support sanitize commands, or if supported, the interfaces are not
supported in a standardized way across these devices. Sanitation-resistant media include, for example,
compact flash, embedded flash on boards and devices, solid state drives, and USB removable media.
Related control: MP-6.

a. b. c. d. MP-8 MEDIA DOWNGRADING
Control: The organization:
Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media downgrading process] that
includes employing downgrading mechanisms with [Assignment: organization-defined strength and
integrity];
Ensures that the information system media downgrading process is commensurate with the security
category and/or classification level of the information to be removed and the access authorizations of
the potential recipients of the downgraded information;
Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined information system media requiring downgrading]; and
Downgrades the identified information system media using the established process.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to all information system media, digital and non-digital, subject
to release outside of the organization, whether or not the media is considered removable. The downgrading
process, when applied to system media, removes information from the media, typically by security category
or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of
media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. Downgrading of media also
ensures that empty space on the media (e.g., slack space within files) is devoid of information.
Control Enhancements:
(1) MEDIA DOWNGRADING | DOCUMENTATION OF PROCESS
The organization documents information system media downgrading actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can document the media downgrading process by providing
information such as the downgrading technique employed, the identification number of the
downgraded media, and the identity of the individual that authorized and/or performed the
downgrading action.
(2) MEDIA DOWNGRADING | EQUIPMENT TESTING
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined tests] of downgrading equipment and procedures to
verify correct performance [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
(3) MEDIA DOWNGRADING | CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION
The organization downgrades information system media containing [Assignment: organization-defined Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI)] prior to public release in accordance with applicable federal and organizational
standards and policies.
(4) MEDIA DOWNGRADING | CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
The organization downgrades information system media containing classified information prior to release to
individuals without required access authorizations in accordance with NSA standards and policies.
Supplemental Guidance: Downgrading of classified information uses approved sanitization tools,
techniques, and procedures to transfer information confirmed to be unclassified from classified
information systems to unclassified media.
This control may only need to be addressed if a system downgrade or tech transfer is
required, e.g., based on an authorized administrative information downgrade
(classification/program levels) by an Original Classification Authority (OCA).

FAMILY: PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
This section comprises the physical and environmental protections for the DoD SAP Community and
for all information systems under the purview of the CA SAPCOs as they relate to physical and
environmental protection. Reference also DoDM 5205.07-V3, DoD SAP Security Manual: Physical
Security Guidance for Special Access Program Facilities (SAPFs), April 23, 2015.
PE-1 a. 2. b. PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A physical and environmental protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy
and associated physical and environmental protection controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Physical and environmental protection policy at least annually; and
Physical and environmental protection procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PE family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to physical and environmental protection
are defined in the remainder of this section. All SAPFs must be accredited (and TEMPEST
certified as necessary) prior to receiving system authorization to operate.
In facilities invoking OSD Memo: Approval for use of DoD SAPFs and Special Access
Compartmented Areas (SAPCA) as Special Access Program Working Areas (SAPWA) for
All DoD SAPs, dated December 10, 2015, security must ensure coordination with the
ISSM/ISSO on situations where processing non-persistent information must be addressed.
Address SCADA systems such as HVAC, fire suppression, lights and power distribution, the
facility manager should work with the provider to mitigate risk to the SAP environment. Big
voice systems (announcement systems) should be configured as unidirectional, i.e., not also a
microphone. Ensure these systems are managed to mitigate risk associated with devices in
use, e.g., disable wireless features and control access to the system/devices. Reference
DoDM 5205.07-V3 and the appropriate technical specifications.
Refer to DoDM 5205.07-V3 for additional information on facility accreditation and
TEMPEST requirements.

a. b. c. d. PE-2 PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS
Control: The organization:
Develops, approves, and maintains a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the
information system resides;
Issues authorization credentials for facility access;
Reviews the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals at least annually; and
Removes individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer required.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g.,
employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not
considered visitors. Authorization credentials include, for example, badges, identification cards, and smart
cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed (including level of forge-
proof badges, smart cards, or identification cards) consistent with federal standards, policies, and
procedures. This control only applies to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly
accessible. Related controls: PE-3, PE-4, PS-3.
Ensure SAP Support Systems are controlled within a SAPF and managed by SAP cleared
individuals. SAP Support Systems include card/badge creation systems, card reader systems,
alarm systems, and music sound cover systems. These systems may be addressed in the
Fixed Facility Checklist (FFC) or Facility SOP.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | ACCESS BY POSITION / ROLE
The organization authorizes physical access to the facility where the information system resides based on position or
role.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6.
PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | TWO FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION
The organization requires two forms of identification from [Assignment: organization-defined list of acceptable forms
of identification] for visitor access to the facility where the information system resides.
Supplemental Guidance: Acceptable forms of government photo identification include, for example,
passports, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards, and drivers’ licenses. In the case of gaining
access to facilities using automated mechanisms, organizations may use PIV cards, key cards, PINs,
and biometrics. Related controls: IA-2, IA-4, IA-5.
PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | RESTRICT UNESCORTED ACCESS
The organization restricts unescorted access to the facility where the information system resides to personnel with
security clearances and/or formal access approval as defined by the local security policy (i.e., Facility SOP).
Supplemental Guidance: Due to the highly sensitive nature of classified information stored within certain
facilities, it is important that individuals lacking sufficient security clearances, access approvals, or
need to know, be escorted by individuals with appropriate credentials to ensure that such information is
not exposed or otherwise compromised. Related controls: PS-2, PS-6.
Consider tailoring in PE-5 (2) for an environment where not everyone has formal access
to all information to restrict access to printer output. Also consider tailoring in PE-6(2)
for multi-system server rooms.

PE-3 PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL
Control: The organization:
Enforces physical access authorizations at [Assignment: organization-defined entry/exit points to the
facility where the information system resides] by;
1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and
a. Chapter 3-PE PAGE 3-191
2. b. c. d. e. f. g. Controlling ingress/egress to the facility using [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
organization-defined physical access control systems/devices]; guards];
Maintains physical access audit logs for [Assignment: organization-defined entry/exit points];
Provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to control access to areas within the
facility officially designated as publicly accessible;
Escorts visitors and monitors visitor activity [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances
requiring visitor escorts and monitoring];
Secures keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;
Inventories [Assignment: organization-defined physical access devices] every [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and
Changes combinations and keys when first installed or used and/or when keys are lost, combinations
are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g.,
employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not
considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed including, for example,
professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information system
users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers.
Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras,
monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured
areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management
Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for
physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit
logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access
occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical
access points can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or
components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information
systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible with
organizations safeguarding access to such devices. Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, MP-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-
4, PE-5, PS-3, RA-3.
Physical casings include for example, locking computer racks to protect mission critical
servers, network routers, etc. As an alternative, these devices may be secured in a room (e.g.,
a server room) with access limited to privileged users.
Control Enhancements:

The organization enforces physical access authorizations to the information system in addition to the physical access
controls for the facility at [Assignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more components of
the information system].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides additional physical security for those areas
within facilities where there is a concentration of information system components (e.g., server rooms,
media storage areas, data and communications centers). Related control: PS-2.
PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | FACILITY / INFORMATION SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
The organization performs security checks [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at the physical boundary of
the facility or information system for unauthorized exfiltration of information or removal of information system
components.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security
checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration. Related controls: AC-4, SC-7.

Keyboard/Video/Mouse Switch Usage
The application of multi-use or keyboard/video/mouse (KVM) switches provides substantial
benefits, in cost reduction, space utilization, and operations enhancement when properly
procured, installed, configured, and managed. The introduction and use of these devices in a
Chapter 3-PE PAGE 3-193
SAP environment, however, presents a moderate degree of risk to classified or sensitive
information and systems.
To minimize the risk of inadvertently entering information onto the wrong network, the
following requirements shall be satisfied when using KVM switches in SAPFs:
• KVM switches shall be authorized via approved configuration control processes and be
annotated in the appropriate system documentation.
• The AO shall approve the connection of any information system to a KVM switch.
When connecting a KVM switch to systems/networks with multiple AOs, each AO’s
approval shall be obtained prior to installation. Best practice dictates that a KVM
switch used across classifications or security boundaries should conform to the
National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) approved Protection Profiles (PP)
for peripheral sharing switches and be identified on the NIAP Product Compliant List
(PCL) or the NIAP Validated Products List (VPL). Products that have been moved to
the NIAP Archived Products List may continue to be used if already deployed within
an organization’s IT infrastructure.
• KVM switches shall be installed in facilities approved for operation of the highest
classification information system by authorized SAs or maintenance personnel.
• USB keyboard/mouse connections must only allow Human Interface Device (HID)
type (i.e., manual operation) connections. Systems using KVM switches shall not use
keyboards or mice with wireless technology.
• Positive and deliberate operator action is required to switch between connected
systems; switches that automatically scan and switch between systems are not
authorized; hot key switching capability is only authorized when all connected systems
operate at the same classification level and accesses. Note: A KVM switch between
components of the same system (e.g., between a file server and a mail server) need not
be certified unless otherwise indicated by the CTTA.
• Systems using KVM switches shall not employ “smart” or memory enhanced/data
retaining keyboards, monitors or mice. These types of interfaces provide memory
retention that creates a risk of data transfer between systems of different classifications.
• Systems joined by multi-position switches shall utilize desktop backgrounds or banner
software that display classification banners at the top and bottom. The classification
banner will state the overall classification and approved digraphs/trigraphs (or ‘SAR’)
for the system in large bold type, and the banner background will be in a solid color
that matches the classification (e.g., TS//SCI - yellow, Top Secret - orange, Secret -
red, Confidential - blue, Unclassified - green). When systems have a similar
classification level (e.g., SECRET and SECRET//NOFORN), but require separation for
accessibility, releasability or other constraints, use of unique colors for the different
systems is allowed.
• Screen lock applications shall display the maximum classification of the system
currently logged into and shall require the user to re-authenticate to unlock the screen.
• Data of a higher classification shall not be introduced into a system of a lower
classification.
• The use of switchboxes for print services between classification and compartment
levels is prohibited. Switchboxes may be used between the same classification and
compartment levels for print services.
• Users shall ensure different/unique passwords are used for each system connected
Chapter 3-PE PAGE 3-194
through a multi-position switch.
• ISSM/ISSO/Supervisors shall ensure user training and compliance to the requirements
associated with the introduction and use of multi-position switches.
Keyboard/Video/Mouse Switch Configuration
All KVM switch positions, cables, and connectors shall be clearly marked with the
appropriate classification labels and corresponding color. Refer to Figure 3-2, SF 700 Series
Labels.
The ISSM/ISSO is responsible for ensuring consistent port order and identification of all
KVM switches within the SAPF. Where possible, a blank port shall be used between
unclassified and classified networks. In addition, if multiple ports are unused, blank ports
shall be placed between classification levels whenever possible. There is no requirement to
apply tamper-resistant tape or other physical mechanisms to KVM switches. The following
order shall be used for all KVM switches within SAPFs:
• NIPRNet
• S//REL
• Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet)
• S//SAR
• TS Collateral
• Coalition SCI

PE-19 INFORMATION LEAKAGE
Control: The organization protects the information system from information leakage due to electromagnetic
signals emanations.
Supplemental Guidance: Information leakage is the intentional or unintentional release of information to an
untrusted environment from electromagnetic signals emanations. Security categories or classifications of
information systems (with respect to confidentiality) and organizational security policies guide the
selection of security controls employed to protect systems against information leakage due to
electromagnetic signals emanations.
Information systems, peripherals, associated data communications, and networks (planned or
installed) that may be used to process national security or security-related information may
need to meet certain national TEMPEST policies and procedures. TEMPEST is a short name
(not an acronym) referring to investigations and studies of compromising emanations.
Reference CNSSP 300, CNSSI 7000 and NSTISSI 7001.
TEMPEST-relevant definitions include:
• BLACK. Designation applied to information systems, and to associated areas,
circuits, components, and equipment, in which national security information is
encrypted or is not processed.
• Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority (CTTA). An experienced, technically
qualified U.S. Government employee who has met established certification
requirements in accordance with CNSS approved criteria and has been appointed by
a U.S. Government department or agency to fulfill CTTA responsibilities.
• Compromising Emanations. Unintentional signals that, if intercepted and analyzed,
would disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise
Chapter 3-PE PAGE 3-201
processed by telecommunications or automated information systems equipment.
• Inspectable Space. The three dimensional space surrounding equipment that
processes classified and/or sensitive information within which TEMPEST
exploitation is not considered practical, or where legal authority to identify and
remove a potential TEMPEST exploitation exists and is exercised. CTTAs have the
authority to define the inspectable space.
• RED. Designation applied to an IS, and associated areas, circuits, components, and
equipment in which unencrypted national security information is being processed.
• RED/BLACK Concept. Separation of electrical and electronic circuits, components,
equipment, and systems that handle national security information (RED), in
electrical form, from those that handle non-national security information (BLACK)
in the same form.
TEMPEST Compliance
The CTTA will determine if there is a TEMPEST requirement and will provide the
recommended TEMPEST countermeasures to the PSO. TEMPEST countermeasures may
include RED/BLACK installation, facility shielding, and or/the use of TEMPEST equipment.
When compliance with TEMPEST standards is required, the PSO will issue specific
guidance. PSOs may refer to CNSSI 7000, TEMPEST Countermeasures for Facilities, and
NSTISSI 7001, NONSTOP Countermeasures, for the criteria to have a TEMPEST
Countermeasures Review performed by a CTTA. It may also be necessary to contact a
CTTA to obtain the threat environment.
TEMPEST Accreditation
When TEMPEST countermeasures are directed by the PSO, TEMPEST accreditation is
based on verification of the countermeasures by inspection, test, and/or analysis. Refer to
DoDM 5205.07-V3 for additional information on facility accreditation and TEMPEST
requirements.
TEMPEST Installation Requirements
RED/BLACK separation in accordance with CNSSAM TEMPEST/1-13 is recommended for
all SAPFs when it can be performed - within manageable cost parameters.
When RED/BLACK installation is specified by the PSO for TEMPEST compliance, SAPFs
will follow the installation requirements in CNSSAM TEMPEST/1-13. The TEMPEST/1-13
requirements level and specific guidance is provided by the CTTA.
Color coding or labeling that aids individuals in identifying the intended data carried by the
cabling and validating its connections and proximity to emanations security concerns.
Wireless, IR, and radio devices in SAPFs must be reviewed and approved by the CA SAPCO
or PSO prior to introduction into the facility.

FAMILY: PLANNING
PL-1 a. 2. b. SECURITY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A security planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security planning policy and associated security
planning controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Security planning policy at least annually; and
Security planning procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PL family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

Control: The organization:
Develops a security plan for the information system that:
1. 2. 3. Is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture;
Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system;
Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions and business
processes;
Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale;
Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or
connections to other information systems;
Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;
Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable;
Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements including a
rationale for the tailoring decisions; and
Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan
implementation;

b. c. d. e. Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
Reviews the security plan for the information system at least annually or when required due to
system changes or modifications;
Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or problems
identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and
Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Supplemental Guidance: Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and control
enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control
enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the
specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient
information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either
explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the
intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can
also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to
develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or
missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal
Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on
developing overlays.
Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents including
documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies,
procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed
information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security
programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas
related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For
example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but
instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished
by those plans. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-20, CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, CM-9, CP-2,

SAP organizations shall ensure an SSP is developed for each information system that:
• Conforms to the service/agency-accepted SSP template for SAP IS.
• Identifies the tailored controls (tailored in/out/modified) approved by the AO.
• Identifies any exceptions, which denotes a control or part of a control that is not met
and is an accepted risk by the AO. Exceptions should also be captured on the
POA&M unless otherwise directed by the AO.
• Is approved by the AO through coordination with the SCA prior to plan
implementation
Information System Owner (ISO) Responsibilities
As stated in 1.5.12, the ISO is responsible for ensuring development and maintenance of the
documentation for a security authorization package, to include the SSP and SCTM.
The ISO shall ensure the SSP is reviewed at least annually and updated to address changes to
the information system/environment of operation as well as problems identified during plan
implementation or security control assessments.
Reference [CA-6] for examples of changes requiring SSP updates and Chapter 1 of this
document for additional ISO responsibilities.
Chapter 3-PL PAGE 3-205
SSP Content Classification
Oftentimes the use of Unclassified Handle Via Special Access Channels Only (U//HVSACO)
is used for SSPs to preclude the disclosure of general program-related information outside
established SAP channels, minimize OPSEC indicators, and facilitate communication of
information within SAPs. Consult your Service/Agency representatives for proper
classification guidance based upon applicable SCGs or other requirements.
Black IP addresses captured in an SSP for SAP systems are generally unclassified.
Red IP addresses captured in an SSP for SAP systems shall be protected within SAP
channels.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-2].
a. b. PL-4 RULES OF BEHAVIOR
Control: The organization:
Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access to the information system, the
rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to information and
information system usage;
Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have read, understand,
and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and the
information system;
Reviews and updates the rules of behavior At least annually; and
Requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and resign
when the rules of behavior are revised/updated.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations consider
rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for example, between
rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for
some types of non-organizational users including, for example, individuals who simply receive
data/information from federal information systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such
users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational
and non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed
c. d. Chapter 3-PL PAGE 3-206
acknowledgment portion of this control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based
security training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior.
Organizations can use electronic signatures for acknowledging rules of behavior. Related controls: AC-2,
AC-6, AC-8, AC-9, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, AT-2, AT-3, CM-11, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MP-7, PS-6,
PS-8, SA-5.
Rules of Behavior are addressed as part of user security awareness and training [AT-3] as
well as [PL-4]. Signed acknowledgement of the rules of behavior is covered via user access
agreements. See User Agreements [PS-6].
The responsibilities of a General user shall include:
• Reading and signing the Standard Mandatory Notice and Consent Provision for all
DoD Information System User Agreements.
• Use the system for official use only. Appropriate personal use of IS must be consistent
with organizational policy.
• Access only that data, system information, software, hardware, and firmware for which
they are authorized access and have a need-to-know, and assume only those roles and
privileges for which they are authorized.
• Observe rules and regulations governing the secure operation and authorized use of IS.
• Complete, at minimum, annual IA awareness training.
• DO NOT introduce malicious code into any IS or physically damage the system.
• DO NOT bypass, strain, or test security mechanisms. If security mechanisms must be
bypassed for any reason, users shall coordinate with the ISSO and receive written
permission from the ISSM to bypass security mechanisms.
• DO NOT introduce or use unauthorized software, firmware, or hardware on an IS.
• DO NOT relocate or change IS equipment or its network connectivity without proper
security authorization.
• Secure unattended IS by invoking screen lock or logging off. Screen lock shall be
employed for absences of a short duration. For any extended absence (more than six
hours) and at the end of each workday, users are required to logout of all systems.
• Safeguard and report any unexpected or unrecognizable output products to the
ISSO/SA as appropriate. This includes both displayed and printed products.
• Safeguard and report the receipt of any media received through any channel to the
appropriate ISSO/SA for subsequent virus inspection and inclusion into the media
control procedures. See also Media Access [MP-2].
• Protect IS and IS peripherals located in the user’s area from unauthorized access.
• Protect all authenticators (e.g., passwords, smart card personal identification numbers
(PIN)/passwords, PKI private certificates) from disclosure to entities other than the
user, system authentication components, and the authorized authenticator distribution
entities. Single factor authenticators shall be protected commensurate with the
information sensitivity accessible by the associated entity. Reference IA-5(6). Report
any compromise or suspected compromise of an authenticator to the appropriate ISSO.
Ensure all system media and output products are properly classified, marked,
controlled, stored, transported, and destroyed. See also the Media Protection (MP)
section.
• Immediately report all actual or suspected security incidents and potential threats and
vulnerabilities involving an IS and/or network to the appropriate ISSO/SA or ISSM via
Chapter 3-PL PAGE 3-207
secure means.
• DO NOT tamper with access doors, covers, plates and TEMPEST seals on IS.
• Inform the appropriate ISSO/SA when access to a particular IS is no longer required
(e.g., completion of project, transfer, retirement, resignation).
In addition to the requirements for a general user, privileged users shall:
• Access only the specific data, control information, software, hardware, and firmware
for which they are authorized access and have a need-to-know, and assume only those
roles and privileges for which they are authorized.
• NOT use privileged user accounts to perform routine, non-administrative daily tasks
(such as web browsing or reading electronic mail) as these activities may
unintentionally damage or expose the system to attacks that are delivered via everyday
applications.
• NOT use their privileged user accesses to alter, change or destroy information (e.g.,
audit logs, security-related objects and directories) without approval from the
appropriate legal authority.
• Protect the “root” or “super user” authenticator at the highest level of data it secures.
• Use special accesses or permissions to perform only authorized tasks and functions.
• Take necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of information encountered
while performing privileged duties.
• Do not use special accesses or permissions to perform general user functions.
• Report and document all system security configuration changes and detected/suspected
security-related IS problems that might adversely impact IS security to the ISSM.
Password Misuse or Compromise
Users shall take precautions to protect their passwords from misuse and compromise. A
password shall be changed immediately if misuse or compromise of the password is known
or suspected. Suspected misuse or compromise of a password shall be reported to the
ISSM/ISSO. Discovery of unauthorized use, possession, or downloading of a password-
cracking tool shall be immediately reported to the ISSM/ISSO. Organizations shall establish
procedures for all users to change their passwords, for example, in response to an incident
affecting an information system resource, should such a response be required.
Control Enhancements:
(1) RULES OF BEHAVIOR | SOCIAL MEDIA AND NETWORKING RESTRICTIONS
The organization includes in the rules of behavior, explicit restrictions on the use of social media/networking sites
and posting organizational information on public websites.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses rules of behavior related to the use of
social media/networking sites: (i) when organizational personnel are using such sites for official duties
or in the conduct of official business; (ii) when organizational information is involved in social
media/networking transactions; and (iii) when personnel are accessing social media/networking sites
from organizational information systems. Organizations also address specific rules that prevent
unauthorized entities from obtaining and/or inferring non-public organizational information (e.g.,
system account information, personally identifiable information) from social media/networking sites.

PL-6 SECURITY-RELATED ACTIVITY PLANNING
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-2].
a. b. PL-7 SECURITY CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
Control: The organization:
Develops a security Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the information system containing at a
minimum, how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information
security; and
Reviews and updates the CONOPS at least annually or when changes to the information system or
its environment warrant.
Supplemental Guidance: The security CONOPS may be included in the security plan for the information
system or in other system development life cycle-related documents, as appropriate. Changes to the
CONOPS are reflected in ongoing updates to the security plan, the information security architecture, and
other appropriate organizational documents (e.g., security specifications for procurements/acquisitions,
system development life cycle documents, and systems/security engineering documents). Related control:
PL-2.
The CONOPS for the information system includes, at a minimum, the purpose of the system,
description of the system architecture, and data flow.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
a. 2. b. c. PL-8 INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
Control: The organization:
Develops an information security architecture for the information system that:
1. Describes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to protecting
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information;
Describes how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the enterprise
architecture; and
3. Describes any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external services;
Reviews and updates the information security architecture at least annually or when changes to the
information system or its environment warrant to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture; and
Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in the security plan, the
security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and organizational procurements/acquisitions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and development
of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual information system level is
consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture
described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information
security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality
(including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being
exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition,
the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles
and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information
processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and
information system services, and any other specific protection needs.
In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information
resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers.
Chapter 3-PL PAGE 3-209
Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a
comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and
maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is
critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of
the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy
(SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy
requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e.,
internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the
information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise
architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily
directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17
could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is
complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems
or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency
with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture. Related controls: CM-
2, CM-6, PL-2, PM-7, SA-5, SA-17, Appendix J.
Thorough detailed descriptions in the SSP of the system overview, system environment,
facility diagram, network architecture, system diagram, and system connectivity can meet
this control. See NIST Supplemental Guidance above for general contents of Information
Security Architecture.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach that:
(a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations
and architectural layers]; and
(b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually reinforcing manner.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural, technical,
or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple safeguards to
achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to
successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases adversary work factor) and also
increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure
that an attack that involves one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences (e.g.,
lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with another safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a
key activity. Greater asset criticality or information value merits additional layering. Thus, an
organization may choose to place anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web
servers, notebook computers, and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards
adversaries must penetrate before compromising the information and information systems. Related
controls: SC-29, SC-36.
INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] allocated to [Assignment:
organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are obtained from different suppliers.
Supplemental Guidance: Different information technology products have different strengths and
weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For
example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times,
often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to their priorities and
development schedules. By having different products at different locations (e.g., server, boundary,
desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect the malicious code. Related
control: SA-12.
References: None.
Chapter 3-PL PAGE 3-210
PL-9 CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization centrally manages [Assignment: organization-defined security controls and
related processes].
Supplemental Guidance: Central management refers to the organization-wide management and
implementation of selected security controls and related processes. Central management includes planning,
implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed security
controls and processes. As central management of security controls is generally associated with common
controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of security control implementations
and management and judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally-managed security controls and
processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing
authorizations to operate as part of organizational continuous monitoring. As part of the security control
selection process, organizations determine which controls may be suitable for central management based on
organizational resources and capabilities. Organizations consider that it may not always be possible to
centrally manage every aspect of a security control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid
control with the control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information system level.
Controls and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include, but
are not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18 (1) (3) (4) (5); AC-19 (4); AC-22;

This section comprises the personnel security controls for the DoD SAP Community and for all
information systems under the purview of the cognizant SAP AO. Reference also DoDM 5205.07-
V2, DoD SAP Security Manual: Personnel Security, November 24, 2015.
PS-1 a. 2. b. PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A personnel security policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personnel security policy and associated
personnel security controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Personnel security policy at least annually; and
Personnel security procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PS family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

a. b. c. PS-2 POSITION RISK DESIGNATION
Control: The organization:
Assigns a risk designation to all organizational positions;
Establishes screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and
Reviews and updates position risk designations at least annually or when the position description is
updated or when the position is vacated.
Supplemental Guidance: Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management policy and
guidance. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations individuals receive when
accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit
information security role appointment requirements (e.g., training, security clearances). Related controls:
AT-3, PL-2, PS-3.
OPM requires that all positions requiring access to SAP or SCI data be designated as
‘Special-Sensitive’. Access to individual SAP programs will be completed through the
DoDM 5205.07-V2, Personnel Security.

a. b. PS-3 PERSONNEL SCREENING
Control: The organization:
Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system; and
Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined conditions requiring
rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the frequency of such rescreening].
Supplemental Guidance: Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, and specific criteria established for
the risk designations of assigned positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions and
frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of information processed, stored,
or transmitted by the systems. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-2.
Organizations shall further ensure that every user accessing an IS processing, storing, or
transmitting types of classified information which require formal indoctrination, is formally
indoctrinated for all information for which the user is authorized access.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) PERSONNEL SCREENING | CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
The organization ensures that individuals accessing an information system processing, storing, or transmitting
classified information are cleared and indoctrinated to the highest classification level of the information to which they
have access on the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AC-3, AC-4.
PERSONNEL SCREENING | FORMAL INDOCTRINATION
The organization ensures that individuals accessing an information system processing, storing, or transmitting types
of classified information which require formal indoctrination, are formally indoctrinated for all of the relevant types of
information to which they have access on the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Types of classified information requiring formal indoctrination include, for
example, Special Access Program (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), and Sensitive Compartment
Information (SCI). Related controls: AC-3, AC-4.
PERSONNEL SCREENING | INFORMATION WITH SPECIAL PROTECTION MEASURES
The organization ensures that individuals accessing an information system processing, storing, or transmitting
information requiring special protection:
(a) Have valid access authorizations that are demonstrated by assigned official government duties; and
(b) Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational information requiring special protection includes, for example,
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Sources and Methods Information (SAMI). Personnel
security criteria include, for example, position sensitivity background screening requirements.

(3) a. PS-4 PERSONNEL TERMINATION
Control: The organization, upon termination of individual employment:
Disables information system access within, if voluntary: as soon as possible, not to exceed 5
working days. If involuntary: Within same day as termination.
Terminates/revokes any authenticators/credentials associated with the individual;
Conducts exit interviews that include a discussion of the non-disclosure agreement and a discussion of
prohibitions against: (i) the removal of classified information from the organization's control; and (ii)
direction that information be declassified in order to remove it from the organization's control;
b. c. Chapter 3-PS PAGE 3-213
d. e. f. Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property;
Retains access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by
terminated individual; and
Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [as soon as possible, not to
exceed one (1) working day].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication
tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit
interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former
employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information system-related property. Security
topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of
nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be
possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and
nonavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances.
Timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain
situations, organizations consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals that are being
terminated prior to the individuals being notified. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-5, PS-6.
When any system user (to include privileged and general users) leaves the organization due
to employment termination or retirement, the SA responsible for user account management
must ensure all system accesses are removed. This includes notifying other organizations
that may have granted system accesses (for example, collateral systems, database access
managed by another agency or organization). Reference [AC-2] and [IA-4] for additional
details. Notification to the SA and the local security officer of an employee’s termination
shall be documented as the responsibility of the employee’s supervisor or Human Resources.
The organization must also ensure that information deemed to be of value is retained before
the departing user’s accounts are archived and removed. The property custodian must
retrieve any equipment issued to the departing individual, such as laptops or PEDs.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) PERSONNEL TERMINATION | POST-EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
The organization:
(a) Notifies terminated individuals of applicable, legally binding post-employment requirements for the protection of
organizational information; and
(b) Requires terminated individuals to sign an acknowledgment of post-employment requirements as part of the
organizational termination process.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding matters
of post-employment requirements on terminated individuals.
PERSONNEL TERMINATION | AUTOMATED NOTIFICATION
The organization employs automated mechanisms to notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
upon termination of an individual.
Supplemental Guidance: In organizations with a large number of employees, not all personnel who need
to know about termination actions receive the appropriate notifications—or, if such notifications are
received, they may not occur in a timely manner. Automated mechanisms can be used to send
automatic alerts or notifications to specific organizational personnel or roles (e.g., management
personnel, supervisors, personnel security officers, information security officers, systems
administrators, or information technology administrators) when individuals are terminated. Such
automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety of ways, including, for example,
telephonically, via electronic mail, via text message, or via websites.
References: None.
PS-5 PERSONNEL TRANSFER
Control: The organization:
Chapter 3-PS PAGE 3-214
a. b. c. d. Reviews and confirms ongoing operational need for current logical and physical access authorizations
to information systems/facilities when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions
within the organization;
Initiates reassignment actions to ensure all system access no longer required (need to know) are
removed or disabled within ten (10 )working days;
Modifies access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in operational need due to
reassignment or transfer; and
Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment: organization-
defined time period].
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are permanent or
of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted. Organizations define actions appropriate for
the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for
personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include, for example: (i)
returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building passes; (ii) closing information
system accounts and establishing new accounts; (iii) changing information system access authorizations
(i.e., privileges); and (iv) providing for access to official records to which individuals had access at
previous work locations and in previous information system accounts. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2,
PS-4.
Notify other organizations that may have granted system accesses (for example, collateral
systems access, database access managed by another agency or organization) of the
individual’s transfer or reassignment. Notification to the SA of an employee’s transfer or
reassignment shall be documented as the responsibility of the employee’s supervisor or
Human Resources. The property custodian must determine whether any equipment issued to
the individual, such as laptops or PEDs, should be retrieved or transferred to another property
account. Reference AC-2 for additional requirements.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
a. b. c. PS-6 ACCESS AGREEMENTS
Control: The organization:
Develops and documents access agreements for organizational information systems;
Reviews and updates the access agreements at least annually; and
Ensures that individuals requiring access to organizational information and information systems:
1. Sign appropriate access agreements prior to being granted access; and
2. Re-sign access agreements to maintain access to organizational information systems when access
agreements have been updated or at least annually
Supplemental Guidance: Access agreements include, for example, nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use
agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed access agreements include an
acknowledgement that individuals have read, understand, and agree to abide by the constraints associated
with organizational information systems to which access is authorized. Organizations can use electronic
signatures to acknowledge access agreements unless specifically prohibited by organizational policy.
Related control: PL-4, PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, PS-8.
All users are required to read and sign a Standard Mandatory Notice and Consent provision
for all DoD SAP IS, (i.e., General User Access Agreement and Acknowledgement of
Responsibilities) prior to being granted access to DoD SAP information systems. In
addition, privileged users are required to read and sign a DoD SAP Privileged User Access
Chapter 3-PS PAGE 3-215
Agreement and Acknowledgement of Responsibilities prior to being granted elevated
privileges to IS and applications. These agreements must be reviewed and updated upon
account creation, user transfer or user termination. Organizations may add additional
requirements to the agreement provided they do not conflict with the official verbiage. See
Account Management [AC-2] for additional information on user roles and responsibilities.
The User Access Agreement shall be retained by the ISSM/SA for a minimum of two (2)
years after access is removed.
Organizations shall ensure that access to any information with special protection measures is
granted only to individuals who:
• Have a valid access authorization that is demonstrated by assigned official
government duties.
• Satisfy associated personnel security criteria consistent with applicable federal laws,
EOs, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
• Have read, understand, and signed a nondisclosure agreement (if applicable).
Information with special protection measures includes, for example, privacy information,
proprietary information, and Sources and Methods Information (SAMI).

a. PS-7 THIRD-PARTY PERSONNEL SECURITY
Control: The organization:
Establishes personnel security requirements including security roles and responsibilities for third-party
providers;
Requires third-party providers to comply with personnel security policies and procedures established
by the organization;
b. Chapter 3-PS PAGE 3-216
d. c. Documents personnel security requirements;
Requires third-party providers to notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of any
personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials
and/or badges, or who have information system privileges within as soon as possible, not to exceed
one (1) working day; and
e. Monitors provider compliance.
Supplemental Guidance: Third-party providers include, for example, service bureaus, contractors, and other
organizations providing information system development, information technology services, outsourced
applications, and network and security management. Organizations explicitly include personnel security
requirements in acquisition-related documents. Third-party providers may have personnel working at
organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or information system privileges issued by organizations.
Notifications of third-party personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and credentials.
Organizations define the transfers and terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics
that include, for example, functions, roles, and nature of credentials/privileges associated with individuals
transferred or terminated. Related controls: PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, PS-5, PS-6, SA-9, SA-21.
The term 'third party' as it relates to Personnel Security and contracts is not frequently used in
DoD. If a third-party situation seems to apply, contact your AO, PSO, and/or contracting
representative for clarification and guidance.

FAMILY: RISK ASSESSMENT
RA-1 a. 2. b. RISK ASSESSMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and associated risk
assessment controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
Risk assessment policy at least annually; and
Risk assessment procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the RA family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to risk assessment are defined in the
remainder of this section.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. b. c. RA-2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
Control: The organization:
Categorizes information and the information system in accordance with applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;
Documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security plan for
the information system; and
Ensures that the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official
or authorizing official designated representative.
Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective security
categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts to organizational
operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information and information systems are
comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security
categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief information officers,
senior information security officers, information system owners, mission/business owners, and information
owners/stewards. Organizations also consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in
accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential
national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization processes carried out by organizations facilitate the
development of inventories of information assets, and along with CM-8, mappings to specific information
system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted. Related controls: CM-8, MP-4,
RA-3, SC-7.

a. b. c. d. e. RA-3 RISK ASSESSMENT
Control: The organization:
Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the information system
and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;
Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report; [Assignment:
organization-defined document]];
Reviews risk assessment results at least annually;
Disseminates risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; and
Updates the risk assessment at least annually or whenever there are significant changes to the
information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and
vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk
assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the
operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from external
parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization,
individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB
policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information
systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational
assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems.
Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management
hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any
phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the
Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security control
implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control
monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the
implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management
Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes,
particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation.
Related controls: RA-2, PM-9.
Organizations shall conduct a risk assessment for each system under their purview. The risk
assessment shall address the likelihood and magnitude of harm resulting from the
unauthorized disclosure, modification or denial of availability of the system and the
information it processes, stores, or transmits. The risk assessment shall take into account
vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security controls planned or in place to determine the level
of residual risk posed to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and national security based on the operation of the system. The risk
assessment shall also take into account risk to organizational operations, organizational
assets, or individuals from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors’ operating
systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational systems,
outsourcing entities). A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an
Chapter 3-RA PAGE 3-219
effective risk assessment. See Section 2.2.3 for a discussion of information
system/authorization boundaries.
Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted by organizations at various
steps in the RMF including: IS categorization; security control selection; security control
implementation; security control assessment; IS authorization; and security control
monitoring. Risk assessments help senior management make decisions on policy, procedural,
budget, and system operational and management changes.
Risk assessments shall be initiated by ISOs during Step 1 of the RMF, Security
Categorization. The initial risk assessment will evaluate anticipated security vulnerabilities
affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system in the context of the planned
operational environment. The initial risk assessment will conclude with recommendations
for appropriate security safeguards, permitting management to make knowledge-based
decisions about the security controls necessary to properly secure the system based on its
categorization and threat environment.
Results from the initial risk assessment shall be documented in a separate RAR or in the SSP.
The RAR shall include the vulnerabilities, threats, threat sources, other conditions that may
affect the security of the system, and any residual risk incurred by operating the system as
identified in the SSP.
The RAR shall be updated during later stages in the RMF and is an important part of the
security authorization package. The risk assessment process is revisited, as necessary,
throughout the RMF to provide the AO with an updated risk picture reflecting the actual
(versus planned) state of affairs with regard to system implementation, security control
effectiveness, and the operational environment. The RAR for the as-built or as-deployed
system shall include a description of the known vulnerabilities in the system, an assessment
of the risk posed by each identified vulnerability, and corrective actions that can be taken to
mitigate the risks. It shall also include an assessment of the overall risk to the organization
and the information contained in the system by operating the system as evaluated.
The SCA is responsible for reviewing the RAR and providing feedback to the ISO regarding
the completeness of the risk assessment and appropriateness of planned safeguards.
The risk assessment and associated RAR must be reviewed and updated at least annually or
whenever there are significant changes to the IS or environment of operation (including the
identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the
security state of the system.
Control Enhancements: None.

RA-4 RISK ASSESSMENT UPDATE
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into RA-3].
RA-5 VULNERABILITY SCANNING
Control: The organization:
Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications at least quarterly and
when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;
a. Chapter 3-RA PAGE 3-220
b. c. d. e. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and
automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
3. Measuring vulnerability impact;
Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance
with an organizational assessment of risk; and
Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments
with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in
other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
Supplemental Guidance: Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and
comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for
all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked
printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications
may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of
the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-
based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews.
Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions,
ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for
improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations
consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test
for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common
Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition,
security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities
for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4, CM-6, RA-2, RA-3, SA-11,
SI-2.
Organizations shall use AO-approved vulnerability assessment tools and procedures on all
systems to include weapon systems, satellite systems, networks, information systems and
system applications, as appropriate. Vulnerability assessment tools shall have the capability
to readily update the list of system vulnerabilities scanned.
Security Classification Guides should address the protection of information revealing
specific vulnerabilities (other than the known vulnerabilities of widely available commercial
products) and the compiled results of vulnerability analyses for any DoD SAP systems. This
information’s confidentiality requires protection and access to this information must be
controlled IAW Program SCG.
The ISSM/ISSO will ensure analysis of all vulnerability scan reports to determine whether
reported vulnerabilities apply to the system. Some of the potential vulnerabilities reported by
automated scanning tools may not represent real vulnerabilities in the context of the system
environment. For example, some of the “vulnerabilities” flagged by the automated scanning
software may not be applicable for a particular site (i.e., they may be false positives).
Organizations shall attempt to discern what information about the system is discoverable by
adversaries, document the information and determine potential risk.
The ISO is responsible for ensuring all vulnerabilities are remediated based on guidance
provided by the IAVM Program or AO. The ISO shall develop and maintain POA&Ms to
Chapter 3-RA PAGE 3-221
address all vulnerabilities identified by scanning.
Reference Incident Monitoring [IR-5] for more information on IAVM.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) VULNERABILITY SCANNING | UPDATE TOOL CAPABILITY
The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the information
system vulnerabilities to be scanned.
Supplemental Guidance: The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new
vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This updating process
helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the information system are identified and addressed as
quickly as possible. Related controls: SI-3, SI-7.
VULNERABILITY SCANNING | UPDATE BY FREQUENCY / PRIOR TO NEW SCAN / WHEN IDENTIFIED
The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned [Selection (one or more): within 30 days
prior to running scans, prior to a new scan; when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: SI-3, SI-5.
VULNERABILITY SCANNING | BREADTH / DEPTH OF COVERAGE
The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify the breadth and depth of coverage (i.e.,
information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).
VULNERABILITY SCANNING | DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION
The organization determines what information about the information system is discoverable by adversaries and
subsequently takes [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions].
Supplemental Guidance: Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could obtain
without directly compromising or breaching the information system, for example, by collecting
information the system is exposing or by conducting extensive searches of the web. Corrective actions
can include, for example, notifying appropriate organizational personnel, removing designated
information, or changing the information system to make designated information less relevant or
attractive to adversaries. Related control: AU-13.
VULNERABILITY SCANNING | PRIVILEGED ACCESS
The information system implements privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organization-identified
information system components] for selected [Assignment: organization-defined vulnerability scanning activities].
Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more
intrusive or the information system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly
sensitive information. Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates more
thorough vulnerability scanning and also protects the sensitive nature of such scanning.
VULNERABILITY SCANNING | AUTOMATED TREND ANALYSES
The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans over time to
determine trends in information system vulnerabilities.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, SI-4.

Control: The organization employs a technical surveillance countermeasures survey at [Assignment:
organization-defined locations] [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
[Assignment: organization-defined events or indicators occur]].
Supplemental Guidance: Technical surveillance countermeasures surveys are performed by qualified
personnel to detect the presence of technical surveillance devices/hazards and to identify technical security
weaknesses that could aid in the conduct of technical penetrations of surveyed facilities. Such surveys
provide evaluations of the technical security postures of organizations and facilities and typically include
thorough visual, electronic, and physical examinations in and about surveyed facilities. The surveys also
provide useful input into risk assessments and organizational exposure to potential adversaries.

1. A system and services acquisition policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and services acquisition policy and
associated system and services acquisition controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
System and services acquisition policy at least annually; and
System and services acquisition procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SA family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

service in mission/business process planning;
Determines, documents, and allocates the resources required to protect the information system or
information system service as part of its capital planning and investment control process; and
Establishes a discrete line item for information security in organizational programming and budgeting
documentation.
Supplemental Guidance: Resource allocation for information security includes funding for the initial
information system or information system service acquisition and funding for the sustainment of the
system/service. Related controls: PM-3, PM-11.

a. b. c. d. SA-3 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Control: The organization:
Manages the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined system development life
cycle] that incorporates information security considerations;
Defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the system
development life cycle;
Identifies individuals having information security roles and responsibilities; and
Integrates the organizational information security risk management process into system development
life cycle activities.
Supplemental Guidance: A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for the
successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. To apply
the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of
information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business
functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design,
code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do
not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief
information security officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security
officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated
into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the
development team that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security
capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training
programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the
appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.
The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that
important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those
considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also
facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent
with organizational risk management and information security strategies. Related controls: AT-3, PM-7,
SA-8.
Control Enhancements: None.

SA-4 ACQUISITION PROCESS
Control: The organization includes the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by
reference, in the acquisition contract for the information system, system component, or information system
service in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs:
a. Security functional requirements;
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-225
b. Security strength requirements;
c. Security assurance requirements;
d. Security-related documentation requirements;
e. Requirements for protecting security-related documentation;
f. Description of the information system development environment and environment in which the system
is intended to operate; and
g. Acceptance criteria.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology
assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an information system.
Information system components include commercial information technology products. Security functional
requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength
requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness,
completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance
requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii)
evidence from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required
security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security
documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.
Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security
controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security
control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use of
assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation
information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the
implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is
based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which
organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk
response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements
can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports,
protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and
information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational
acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information
security requirements from FISMA. Related controls: CM-6, PL-2, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-
12.
Control Enhancements:
(1) ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SECURITY CONTROLS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to provide a description of the functional properties of the security controls to be employed.
Supplemental Guidance: Functional properties of security controls describe the functionality (i.e.,
security capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and specifically
exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls. Related control: SA-
5.
Obtain, protect as required, and make available to authorized personnel,
vendor/manufacturer documentation that describes the functional properties of the
security controls employed within information systems with sufficient detail to permit
analysis and testing.
(2) ACQUISITION PROCESS | DESIGN / IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION FOR SECURITY CONTROLS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to provide design and implementation information for the security controls to be employed that includes: [Selection
(one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or
hardware schematics; [Assignment: organization-defined design/implementation information]] at [Assignment:
organization-defined level of detail].
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-226
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and
implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational information systems,
system components, or information system services based on mission/business requirements,
requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency, and requirements for analysis and testing. Information
systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain
one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of multiple
subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-
level design for the system is expressed in terms of modules with particular emphasis on software and
firmware (but not excluding hardware) and the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant
functionality. Source code and hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation
representation of the information system. Related control: SA-5.
Require in acquisition documents that vendors/contractors provide information
describing the design and implementation details of the security controls to be employed
within information systems, information system components, or information system
services (including functional interfaces among control components) in sufficient detail
to permit analysis and testing of the controls.
(3) (4) (5) ACQUISITION PROCESS | DEVELOPMENT METHODS / TECHNIQUES / PRACTICES
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle that includes [Assignment: organization-defined state-of-
the-practice system/security engineering methods, software development methods, testing/evaluation/validation
techniques, and quality control processes].
Supplemental Guidance: Following a well-defined system development life cycle that includes state-of-
the-practice software development methods, systems/security engineering methods, quality control
processes, and testing, evaluation, and validation techniques helps to reduce the number and severity of
latent errors within information systems, system components, and information system services.
Reducing the number/severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems,
components, and services. Related control: SA-12.
ACQUISITION PROCESS | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-8 (9)].
ACQUISITION PROCESS | SYSTEM / COMPONENT / SERVICE CONFIGURATIONS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) (b) Deliver the system, component, or service with [Assignment: organization-defined security configurations]
implemented; and
Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or
upgrade.
Supplemental Guidance: Security configurations include, for example, the U.S. Government
Configuration Baseline (USGCB) and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and services.
Security characteristics include, for example, requiring that all default passwords have been changed.
Related control: CM-8.
(6) ACQUISITION PROCESS | USE OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE PRODUCTS
The organization:
(a) Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information assurance (IA)
and IA-enabled information technology products that compose an NSA-approved solution to protect classified
information when the networks used to transmit the information are at a lower classification level than the
information being transmitted; and
Ensures that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or in accordance with NSA-
approved procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: COTS IA or IA-enabled information technology products used to protect
classified information by cryptographic means may be required to use NSA-approved key
management. Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.
(7) ACQUISITION PROCESS | NIAP-APPROVED PROTECTION PROFILES
The organization:
(b) Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-227
(a) (b) (8) (9) Limits the use of commercially provided information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology
products to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance
partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; and
Requires, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially
provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that
the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
ACQUISITION PROCESS | CONTINUOUS MONITORING PLAN
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to produce a plan for the continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness that contains [Assignment:
organization-defined level of detail].
Supplemental Guidance: The objective of continuous monitoring plans is to determine if the complete set
of planned, required, and deployed security controls within the information system, system component,
or information system service continue to be effective over time based on the inevitable changes that
occur. Developer continuous monitoring plans include a sufficient level of detail such that the
information can be incorporated into the continuous monitoring strategies and programs implemented
by organizations. Related control: CA-7.
ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES IN USE
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to identify early in the system development life cycle, the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for
organizational use.
Supplemental Guidance: The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system
development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design phases) allows
organizations to influence the design of the information system, information system component, or
information system service. This early involvement in the life cycle helps organizations to avoid or
minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks and
understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring
information system service providers to do so). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and
services avoids costly retrofitting of security controls after the information system, system component,
or information system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external
information system services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and
services are provided from external sources. Related controls: CM-7, SA-9.

a. SA-5 INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
Control: The organization:
Obtains administrator documentation for the information system, system component, or information
system service that describes:
1. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;
2. Effective use and maintenance of security functions/mechanisms; and
3. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative (i.e., privileged)
functions;
Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or information system
service that describes:
b. Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-228
1. 2. c. d. e. User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security
functions/mechanisms;
Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or service
in a more secure manner; and
3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service;
Documents attempts to obtain information system, system component, or information system service
documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and [Assignment:
organization-defined actions] in response;
Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and
Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and
operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and information
system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the
quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for
example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and
contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such
documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level of
protection provided for selected information system, component, or service documentation is
commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. For example, documentation
associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control system would typically require a
higher level of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses information
system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the
information system, includes, for example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system
operation after any lapse in system operation. Related controls: CM-6, CM-8, PL-2, PL-4, PS-2, SA-3, SA-

SA-8 SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
Control: The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the specification,
design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system.
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-229
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new development
information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply
security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the
current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems. Security engineering principles
include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) establishing sound security policy,
architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security requirements into the
system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that
system developers are trained on how to build secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet
organizational and operational needs; (vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents,
attack vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate
risk; and (viii) reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.
Related controls: PM-7, SA-3, SA-4, SA-17, SC-2, SC-3.
Systems under development or major revision shall assign an ISSE as directed by the AO.
The ISSE shall be appointed in writing, and shall ensure the IS is designed, developed, and
implemented with required security features and safeguards. The ISSE shall consult with the
appropriate security assessor organization(s) as early as possible in the SDLC. The ISO and
the respective ISSE shall ensure the IS security design meets the applicable security
requirements.
For legacy information systems (e.g., legacy OS), organizations shall apply security
engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the
current state of the hardware, software, and firmware within the system.

a. b. c. SA-9 EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES
Control: The organization:
Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational
information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in
accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
and guidance;
Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard to
external information system services; and
Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor security
control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.
Supplemental Guidance: External information system services are services that are implemented outside of
the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes services that are used by,
but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations
using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or
operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that such providers meet the
same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships
with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business
partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and
supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system
services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires
that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the
potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered.
The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the
external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be
monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service
providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-230
agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and
identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. Related controls:
CA-3, IR-7, PS-7.
Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service
providers, the organization shall employ compensating security controls or accept the greater
degree of risk.
Control Enhancements:
(1) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | RISK ASSESSMENTS / ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS
The organization:
(a) Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information
security services; and
(b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is approved by
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident
monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as firewalls,
or key management services. Related controls: CA-6, RA-3.
Organizations should ensure that individuals with the regulatory and organizational
authority to outsource services conduct full scope risk assessments and ensure that
appropriate individuals are involved in this decision. This approval line can be reserved
for CIO, AO, PSO or contracting officer as appropriate based on an organization’s
structure.
(2) (3) EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES
The organization requires providers of all external information systems and services to identify the functions,
ports, protocols, and other services required for the use of such services.
Supplemental Guidance: Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be particularly useful when the
need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions/services or blocking
certain ports/protocols. Related control: CM-7.
EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | ESTABLISH / MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS
The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships with external service providers based on
[Assignment: organization-defined security requirements, properties, factors, or conditions defining acceptable trust
relationships].
Supplemental Guidance: The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an
acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers, individually or
in combination. Trust relationships can help organization to gain increased levels of confidence that
participating service providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered. Such
relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities participating in the consumer-
provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and the types of interactions
between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the amount of direct control
organizations are able to exert on external service providers with regard to employment of security
controls necessary for the protection of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the
effectiveness of those controls. The level of control is typically established by the terms and conditions
of the contracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating
contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited control
(e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as commercial
telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors that convince
organizations that required security controls have been employed and that determinations of control
effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external information system services provided
to organizations through well-established business relationships may provide degrees of trust in such
services within the tolerable risk range of the organizations using the services. External service
providers may also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the trust relationship
more difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-231
(4) (5) find it very difficult to place significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent
untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.
EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that the interests of
[Assignment: organization-defined external service providers] are consistent with and reflect organizational interests.
Supplemental Guidance: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the possibility
exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such
situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational safeguards in place may not
be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control those safeguards are not operating in a
manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations. Possible actions that
organizations might take to address such concerns include, for example, requiring background checks
for selected service provider personnel, examining ownership records, employing only trustworthy
service providers (i.e., providers with which organizations have had positive experiences), and
conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to service provider facilities.
EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION
The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing; information/data;
information system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations] based on [Assignment: organization-
defined requirements or conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: The location of information processing, information/data storage, or
information system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the ability of
those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This situation exists
when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services. The criteria external
providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from
organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure that data/information storage
locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident response activities (e.g., forensic
analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information security breaches/compromises. Such
incident response activities may be adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the
locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which information system
services emanate.

a. b. c. d. SA-10 DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:
Perform configuration management during system, component, or service [design, development,
implementation, and operation];
Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to [Assignment: organization-defined
configuration items under configuration management];
Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service;
Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security impacts of
such changes; and
Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service and report findings
to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel].
Supplemental Guidance: This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information systems
development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration
management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards.
Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction, the master
copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and
firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information system component,
or information system service requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle
to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under
e. Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-232
configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal
model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation
documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for
comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code
with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of
organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration
management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle. Related controls: CM-
3, CM-4, CM-9, SA-12, SI-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes
to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms
provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address counterfeiting of software
and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of software and firmware components,
for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by developers. Delivered software and firmware
components also include any updates to such components. Related control: SI-7.
DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
The organization provides an alternate configuration management process using organizational personnel in the
absence of a dedicated developer configuration management team.
Supplemental Guidance: Alternate configuration management processes may be required, for example,
when organizations use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products. Alternate
configuration management processes include organizational personnel that: (i) are responsible for
reviewing/approving proposed changes to information systems, system components, and information
system services; and (ii) conduct security impact analyses prior to the implementation of any changes
to systems, components, or services (e.g., a configuration control board that considers security impacts
of changes during development and includes representatives of both the organization and the
developer, when applicable).
DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to enable integrity verification of hardware components.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes
to hardware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by
developers. Organizations verify the integrity of hardware components, for example, with hard-to-copy
labels and verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and by requiring the implementation of
anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components also include updates to such components.
Related control: SI-7.
DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED GENERATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to employ tools for comparing newly generated versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and
software/firmware source and object code with previous versions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software, and
firmware components between versions during development. In contrast, SA-10 (1) and SA-10 (3)
allow organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware, software, and firmware components
through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers.
DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | MAPPING INTEGRITY FOR VERSION CONTROL
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to maintain the integrity of the mapping between the master build data (hardware drawings and software/firmware
code) describing the current version of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware and the on-site master
copy of the data for the current version.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software, and
firmware components during initial development and during system life cycle updates. Maintaining the
integrity between the master copies of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware (including
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-233
(6) designs and source code) and the equivalent data in master copies on-site in operational environments
is essential to ensure the availability of organizational information systems supporting critical missions
and/or business functions.
DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED DISTRIBUTION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to execute procedures for ensuring that security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware updates distributed to the
organization are exactly as specified by the master copies.
Supplemental Guidance: The trusted distribution of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware
updates helps to ensure that such updates are faithful representations of the master copies maintained
by the developer and have not been tampered with during distribution.

SA-11 c. d. e. DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION
Control: information system service to:
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
a. Create and implement a security assessment plan;
b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation at
[Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];
Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the security
testing/evaluation;
Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and
Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.
Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases of the
system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting
established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected by the
interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes
(e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect previously
implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of security testing/evaluation that
developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may
require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three
approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based
application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security
assessment plans provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of
analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be
applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation
refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or
white box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of
the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security
assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes have been
diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation
are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts
may specify documentation protection requirements. Related controls: CA-2, CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SI-
2.
Security testing and evaluation will be conducted, in consultation with associated security
personnel (including security engineers):
• An objective of the flaw remediation process is to correct weaknesses and
deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process.
• The results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation process should be
documented.
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-234
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | STATIC CODE ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.
Supplemental Guidance: Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security
reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and enforce security coding
practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the development process, when
each code change can be automatically scanned for potential weaknesses. Static analysis can provide
clear remediation guidance along with defects to enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of
correct implementation of static analysis can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical
defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and
evidence that defects were fixed. An excessively high density of ignored findings (commonly referred
to as ignored or false positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool. In such
cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | THREAT AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSES
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to perform threat and vulnerability analyses and subsequent testing/evaluation of the as-built system, component, or
service.
(3) (b) (4) (5) Supplemental Guidance: Applications may deviate significantly from the functional and design
specifications created during the requirements and design phases of the system development life cycle.
Therefore, threat and vulnerability analyses of information systems, system components, and
information system services prior to delivery are critical to the effective operation of those systems,
components, and services. Threat and vulnerability analyses at this phase of the life cycle help to
ensure that design or implementation changes have been accounted for, and that any new
vulnerabilities created as a result of those changes have been reviewed and mitigated. Related controls:
PM-15, RA-5.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT PLANS / EVIDENCE
The organization:
(a) Requires an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined independence criteria] to verify the
correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and the evidence produced during security
testing/evaluation; and
Ensures that the independent agent either is provided with sufficient information to complete the verification
process or has been granted the authority to obtain such information.
Supplemental Guidance: Independent agents have the necessary qualifications (i.e., expertise, skills,
training, and experience) to verify the correct implementation of developer security assessment plans.
Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, RA-5, SA-12.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | MANUAL CODE REVIEWS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to perform a manual code review of [Assignment: organization-defined specific code] using [Assignment:
organization-defined processes, procedures, and/or techniques].
Supplemental Guidance: Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and firmware
components of information systems. Such code reviews are uniquely effective at identifying
weaknesses that require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context which are generally
unavailable to more automated analytic tools and techniques such as static or dynamic analysis.
Components benefiting from manual review include for example, verifying access control matrices
against application controls and reviewing more detailed aspects of cryptographic implementations and
controls.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to perform penetration testing at [Assignment: organization-defined breadth/depth] and with [Assignment:
organization-defined constraints].
Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors, using all
available information technology product and/or information system documentation (e.g.,
product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator manuals) and working
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-235
(6) (7) under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security features of information
technology products and information systems. Penetration testing can include, for example, white,
gray, or black box testing with analyses performed by skilled security professionals simulating
adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover potential vulnerabilities in
information technology products and information systems resulting from implementation errors,
configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can
be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide greater levels of
analysis than would ordinarily be possible.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | ATTACK SURFACE REVIEWS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to perform attack surface reviews.
Supplemental Guidance: Attack surfaces of information systems are exposed areas that make those
systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. This includes any accessible areas where weaknesses or
deficiencies in information systems (including the hardware, software, and firmware components)
provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack surface reviews ensure that
developers: (i) analyze both design and implementation changes to information systems; and (ii)
mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes. Correction of identified flaws includes, for
example, deprecation of unsafe functions.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | VERIFY SCOPE OF TESTING / EVALUATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage of required security controls at
[Assignment: organization-defined depth of testing/evaluation].
Supplemental Guidance: Verifying that security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage of
required security controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging from
informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance corresponding
to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating security control coverage at the
highest levels of assurance can be provided by the use of formal modeling and analysis techniques
including correlation between control implementation and corresponding test cases.
DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | DYNAMIC CODE ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.
Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software programs,
using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege issues, and other
potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools to help to ensure that
security functionality performs in the manner in which it was designed. A specialized type of dynamic
analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or
random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies derive from the intended use of
applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope
of dynamic code analysis and hence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider
conducting code coverage analysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using
metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution
of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code
such as non-English language words or derogatory terms).

(8) SA-12 SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION
Control: The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system
component, or information system service by employing security safeguards in accordance with CNSSD
No. 505, Supply Chain Risk Management as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information
security strategy.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems (including system components that compose those systems)
need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, development,
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-236
manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and
retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by
the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use
of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing
a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system
components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls.
Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement
necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the
supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking
delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to information system
services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems,
development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development
personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing
and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security
category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection
requirements. Related controls: AT-3, CM-8, IR-4, PE-16, PL-8, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-10, SA-14, SA-15,
SA-18, SA-19, SC-29, SC-30, SC-38, SI-7.
Organizations shall conduct a due diligence review of suppliers prior to entering into
contractual agreements to acquire information system hardware, software, firmware, or
services including a review of supplier claims with regard to the use of appropriate security
processes in the development and manufacture of information system components or
products.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ACQUISITION STRATEGIES / TOOLS / METHODS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined tailored acquisition strategies, contract tools, and
procurement methods] for the purchase of the information system, system component, or information system service
from suppliers.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of acquisition and procurement processes by organizations early in the
system development life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. Organizations
use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of acquisition strategies, tools, and
methods. There are a number of different tools and techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of
an information system or system component, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider
creating incentives for suppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards; (ii) promote
transparency into their organizational processes and security practices; (iii) provide additional vetting
of the processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system
components, and services; (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v) provide
contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In addition,
organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required delivery to limit
opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or products. Finally,
organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and warehousing options to reduce
supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of information system components during
shipping and warehousing). Related control: SA-19.
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | SUPPLIER REVIEWS
The organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to acquire the information
system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Supplier reviews include, for example: (i) analysis of supplier processes used to
design, develop, test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information systems, system components,
and information system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier training and experience in developing
systems, components, or services with the required security capability. These reviews provide
organizations with increased levels of visibility into supplier activities during the system development
life cycle to promote more effective supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to
determine whether primary suppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting
subordinate suppliers, for example, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | DIVERSITY OF SUPPLIERS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (13)].
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | LIMITATION OF HARM
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to limit harm from potential
adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.
Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT). Security
safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully identifying and
targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of custom configurations to
reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or products that have been corrupted via
supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations; (ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit
the potential harm from any given supplier in the supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists
with standing reputations in industry, and (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to
commitments or obligations).
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | MINIMIZING PROCUREMENT TIME
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (1)].
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION / ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE
The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system component, or information system
service prior to selection, acceptance, or update.
Supplemental Guidance: Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and analyses.
Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct assessments of systems,
components, products, tools, and services. Organizations conduct assessments to uncover unintentional
vulnerabilities and intentional vulnerabilities including, for example, malicious code, malicious
processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can include, for example, static analyses,
dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black box testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and
ensuring that components or services are genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or
digital signatures). Evidence generated during security assessments is documented for follow-on
actions carried out by organizations. Related controls: CA-2, SA-11.
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE
The organization uses all-source intelligence analysis of suppliers and potential suppliers of the information system,
system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: All-source intelligence analysis is employed by organizations to inform
engineering, acquisition, and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of
intelligence products and/or organizations and activities that incorporate all sources of information,
most frequently including human intelligence, imagery intelligence, measurement and signature
intelligence, signals intelligence, and open source data in the production of finished intelligence.
Where available, such information is used to analyze the risk of both intentional and unintentional
vulnerabilities from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the environment.
This review is performed on suppliers at multiple tiers in the supply chain sufficient to manage risks.
Related control: SA-15.
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | OPERATIONS SECURITY
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined Operations Security (OPSEC) safeguards] in
accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information for the information system, system
component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain information includes, for example: user identities; uses for
information systems, information system components, and information system services; supplier
identities; supplier processes; security requirements; design specifications; testing and evaluation
results; and system/component configurations. This control enhancement expands the scope of OPSEC
to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process of identifying critical information and
subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to operations and other activities to: (i) identify those
actions that can be observed by potential adversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might
obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to
cause harm to organizations; (iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-238
an acceptable level, exploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may
compromise the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations
to withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of
intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or
information system services. Related control: PE-21.
(10) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | VALIDATE AS GENUINE AND NOT ALTERED
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to validate that the information
system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered.
Supplemental Guidance: For some information system components, especially hardware, there are
technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered. Security
safeguards used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information system
components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology tagging and side-channel analysis. For
hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with embedded logic
complete with component and production location.
(11) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTS, PROCESSES, AND ACTORS
The organization employs [Selection (one or more): organizational analysis, independent third-party analysis,
organizational penetration testing, independent third-party penetration testing] of [Assignment: organization-defined
supply chain elements, processes, and actors] associated with the information system, system component, or
information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the supply chain,
not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology products or product
components that contain programmable logic and that are critically important to information system
functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i) hardware, software, and firmware
development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures; (iii) personnel and physical security
programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures to maintain provenance; or (v) any other
programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production/distribution of supply chain
elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities in the supply
chain. The evidence generated during analyses and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and
actors is documented and used to inform organizational risk management activities and decisions.
Related control: RA-5.
(12) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL AGREEMENTS
The organization establishes inter-organizational agreements and procedures with entities involved in the supply
chain for the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: The establishment of inter-organizational agreements and procedures provides
for notification of supply chain compromises. Early notification of supply chain compromises that can
potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected organizational information systems, including
critical system components, is essential for organizations to provide appropriate responses to such
incidents.
(13) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure an adequate supply of
[Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by disrupting the
supply of critical information system components or corrupting supplier operations. Safeguards to
ensure adequate supplies of critical information system components include, for example: (i) the use of
multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the identified critical components; and (ii)
stockpiling of spare components to ensure operation during mission-critical times.
(14) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | IDENTITY AND TRACEABILITY
The organization establishes and retains unique identification of [Assignment: organization-defined supply chain
elements, processes, and actors] for the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to
gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as monitoring and
identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and traceability into supply
chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for organizations to understand and
therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Uniquely identifying acquirer
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-239
(15) and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission and element processes, testing and evaluation
procedures, delivery mechanisms, support mechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and
disposal/final disposition activities as well as the components and tools used, establishes a foundational
identity structure for assessment of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial
numbers) and tagging (using radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain
elements including software packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with
those elements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the
provenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event.
SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PROCESSES TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES OR DEFICIENCIES
The organization establishes a process to address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements identified
during independent or organizational assessments of such elements.
Supplemental Guidance: Evidence generated during independent or organizational assessments of supply
chain elements (e.g., penetration testing, audits, verification/validation activities) is documented and
used in follow-on processes implemented by organizations to respond to the risks related to the
identified weaknesses and deficiencies. Supply chain elements include, for example, supplier
development processes and supplier distribution systems.

a. b. SA-13 TRUSTWORTHINESS
Control: The organization:
Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information system,
information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical missions/business
functions; and
Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such trustworthiness.
Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when
designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct critical
organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of an
information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits.
Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined
levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected
to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business
success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security
functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the
system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for
confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers,
operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the level of
assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy models,
structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound
system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of
assurance-related security controls in Appendix E).
Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle.
Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated assurance
requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix E (designated
as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information
systems and system components using the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations
select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g.,
cross-organization, government-wide), limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-
organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-240
information systems, system components, or information system services that require high-assurance
solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for
organizational information systems. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-14, SC-3.
Control Enhancements: None.

SA-14 CRITICALITY ANALYSIS
Control: The organization identifies critical information system components and functions by performing a
criticality analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, information system
components, or information system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the
system development life cycle].
Supplemental Guidance: Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the
prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use of all-source
intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end
functional decomposition of an information system to identify mission-critical functions and components.
The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the
system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the
functions are shared by many components within and beyond the information system boundary.
Information system components that allow for unmediated access to critical components or functions are
considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in
terms of the impact of the function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the
organizational missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever
an architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades. Related controls: CP-2, PL-2,
PL-8, PM-1, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SA-15, SA-20.

SA-15 a. b. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS
Control: The organization:
Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to
follow a documented development process that:
1. Explicitly addresses security requirements;
2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and
4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in
development; and
Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, and tool
options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined security
requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Development tools include, for example, programming languages and computer-
aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for example, the use of
maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of
changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk assessment and mitigation, and requires
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-241
robust configuration control throughout the life cycle (including design, development, transport, delivery,
integration, and maintenance) to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Related
controls: SA-3, SA-8.
Control Enhancements:
(1) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | QUALITY METRICS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) (b) (2) (3) (4) (5) Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and
Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined program review milestones]; upon delivery].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use quality metrics to establish minimum acceptable levels of
information system quality. Metrics may include quality gates which are collections of completion
criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory execution of particular phases of the
system development project. A quality gate, for example, may require the elimination of all compiler
warnings or an explicit determination that the warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of required
security capabilities. During the execution phases of development projects, quality gates provide clear,
unambiguous indications of progress. Other metrics apply to the entire development project. These
metrics can include defining the severity thresholds of vulnerabilities, for example, requiring no known
vulnerabilities in the delivered information system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) severity of Medium or High.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | SECURITY TRACKING TOOLS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to select and employ a security tracking tool for use during the development process.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system development teams select and deploy security tracking
tools, including, for example, vulnerability/work item tracking systems that facilitate assignment,
sorting, filtering, and tracking of completed work items or tasks associated with system development
processes.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | CRITICALITY ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to perform a criticality analysis at [Assignment: organization-defined breadth/depth] and at [Assignment:
organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides developer input to the criticality analysis
performed by organizations in SA-14. Developer input is essential to such analysis because
organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for information system
components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products
(e.g., functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, and source code/hardware
schematics). Related controls: SA-4, SA-14.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | THREAT MODELING / VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
The organization requires that developers perform threat modeling and a vulnerability analysis for the information
system at [Assignment: organization-defined breadth/depth] that:
(a) Uses [Assignment: organization-defined information concerning impact, environment of operations, known or
assumed threats, and acceptable risk levels];
Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and methods]; and
Produces evidence that meets [Assignment: organization-defined acceptance criteria].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SA-4.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ATTACK SURFACE REDUCTION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to reduce attack surfaces to [Assignment: organization-defined thresholds].
Supplemental Guidance: Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with developer threat and
vulnerability analyses and information system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a
means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or
deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within information systems, information system
(b) (c) Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-242
(6) (7) components, and information system services. Attack surface reduction includes, for example,
applying the principle of least privilege, employing layered defenses, applying the principle of least
functionality (i.e., restricting ports, protocols, functions, and services), deprecating unsafe functions,
and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to cyber attacks.
Related control: CM-7.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to implement an explicit process to continuously improve the development process.
Supplemental Guidance: Developers of information systems, information system components, and
information system services consider the effectiveness/efficiency of current development processes for
meeting quality objectives and addressing security capabilities in current threat environments.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | AUTOMATED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) (b) (c) (d) Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: organization-defined tools];
Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;
Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and
Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: RA-5.
(8) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | REUSE OF THREAT / VULNERABILITY INFORMATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current
development process.
Supplemental Guidance: Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can inform
potential design or implementation issues for information systems under development. Similar
information systems or system components may exist within developer organizations. Authoritative
vulnerability information is available from a variety of public and private sector sources including, for
example, the National Vulnerability Database.
(9) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | USE OF LIVE DATA
The organization approves, documents, and controls the use of live data in development and test environments for
the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of live data in preproduction environments can result in significant risk
to organizations. Organizations can minimize such risk by using test or dummy data during the
development and testing of information systems, information system components, and information
system services.
(10) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to provide an incident response plan.
Supplemental Guidance: The incident response plan for developers of information systems, system
components, and information system services is incorporated into organizational incident response
plans to provide the type of incident response information not readily available to organizations. Such
information may be extremely helpful, for example, when organizations respond to vulnerabilities in
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products. Related control: IR-8.
(11) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ARCHIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM / COMPONENT
The organization requires the developer of the information system or system component to archive the system or
component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence supporting the final security review.
Supplemental Guidance: Archiving relevant documentation from the development process can provide a
readily available baseline of information that can be helpful during information system/component
upgrades or modifications.
References: None.
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-243
SA-16 DEVELOPER-PROVIDED TRAINING
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide [Assignment: organization-defined training] on the correct use and
operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training of
personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented within
organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style training, web-
based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also request sufficient training
materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-training to organizational personnel.
Organizations determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of training for
different security functions, controls, or mechanisms. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3, SA-5.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SA-17 a. b. c. DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:
Is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is established within
and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture;
Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security
controls among physical and logical components; and
Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide
required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.
Supplemental Guidance: This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could also be
used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal developers to
help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such security architecture is
integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction is important if/when
organizations outsource the development of information systems, information system components, or
information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with
the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture. Related controls: PL-8,
PM-7, SA-3, SA-8.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL POLICY MODEL
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the [Assignment:
organization-defined elements of organizational security policy] to be enforced; and
(b) Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the
organizational security policy when implemented.
Supplemental Guidance: Formal models describe specific behaviors or security policies using formal
languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors/policies to be formally proven. Not all
components of information systems can be modeled, and generally, formal specifications are scoped to
specific behaviors or policies of interest (e.g., nondiscretionary access control policies). Organizations
choose the particular formal modeling language and approach based on the nature of the
behaviors/policies to be described and the available tools. Formal modeling tools include, for example,
Gypsy and Zed.
DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | SECURITY-RELEVANT COMPONENTS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-244
(a) (b) (3) Define security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
Provide a rationale that the definition for security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware is complete.
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware represent the portion of the
information system, component, or service that must be trusted to perform correctly in order to
maintain required security properties. Related control: SA-5.
DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL CORRESPONDENCE
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (4) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the
interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and
effects;
Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-
level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;
Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant
hardware, software, and firmware; and
Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-
level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.
Supplemental Guidance: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through modeling.
It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, and that any
additional code or implementation details present have no impact on the behaviors or policies being
modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level security properties are satisfied by
the formal information system description, and that the formal system description is correctly
implemented by a description of some lower level, for example a hardware description. Consistency
between the formal top-level specification and the formal policy models is generally not amenable to
being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such
consistency. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the implementation may
require the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods
to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and
firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include,
for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output. Related control: SA-5.
DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | INFORMAL CORRESPONDENCE
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) (b) (c) (d) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level specification that
specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error
messages, and effects;
Show via [Selection: informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as feasible] that the
descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;
Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant
hardware, software, and firmware; and
Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the descriptive
top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.
Supplemental Guidance: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through modeling.
It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, and that any
additional code or implementation details present has no impact on the behaviors or policies being
modeled. Consistency between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e., high-level/low-level design)
and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination
of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. Hardware, software, and
firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include,
for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output. Related control: SA-5.

(5) DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | CONCEPTUALLY SIMPLE DESIGN
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
to:
(a) (b) (6) (7) Design and structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to use a complete, conceptually
simple protection mechanism with precisely defined semantics; and
Internally structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware with specific regard for this
mechanism.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-3.

SA-18 TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION
Control: The organization implements a tamper protection program for the information system, system
component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Anti-tamper technologies and techniques provide a level of protection for critical
information systems, system components, and information technology products against a number of related
threats including modification, reverse engineering, and substitution. Strong identification combined with
tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting information systems, components, and
products during distribution and when in use. Related controls: PE-3, SA-12, SI-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | MULTIPLE PHASES OF SDLC
The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the system
development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and maintenance.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for
tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for example, to
make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for
adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can make substitutions
easier to detect and therefore limit damage. Related control: SA-3.
TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | INSPECTION OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, OR DEVICES
The organization inspects [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices]
[Selection (one or more): at random; at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], upon [Assignment:
organization-defined indications of need for inspection]] to detect tampering.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses both physical and logical tampering and is
typically applied to mobile devices, notebook computers, or other system components taken out of
organization-controlled areas. Indications of need for inspection include, for example, when
individuals return from travel to high-risk locations. Related control: SI-4.

SA-19 COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY
Control: The organization:
Develops and implements anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to detect and
prevent counterfeit components from entering the information system; and
a. Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-246
b. Reports counterfeit information system components to [Selection (one or more): source of counterfeit
component; [Assignment: organization-defined external reporting organizations]; [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles]].
Supplemental Guidance: Sources of counterfeit components include, for example, manufacturers, developers,
vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policy and procedures support tamper resistance and provide
a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations include,
for example, US-CERT. Related controls: PE-3, SA-12, SI-7.
Control Enhancements:

The organization trains [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to detect counterfeit information
system components (including hardware, software, and firmware).
COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY | CONFIGURATION CONTROL FOR COMPONENT SERVICE / REPAIR
The organization maintains configuration control over [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components] awaiting service/repair and serviced/repaired components awaiting return to service.
COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY | COMPONENT DISPOSAL
The organization disposes of information system components using [Assignment: organization-defined techniques
and methods].
Supplemental Guidance: Proper disposal of information system components helps to prevent such
components from entering the gray market.

The organization scans for counterfeit information system components [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
References: None.
SA-20 CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS
Control: The organization re-implements or custom develops [Assignment: organization-defined critical
information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine that certain information system components likely cannot
be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which there are no
viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation or custom
development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. This is accomplished
by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the
standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is
available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom develop critical information system
components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g., enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code
and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and application files. Related controls:
CP-2, SA-8, SA-14.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SA-21 DEVELOPER SCREENING
a. Control: The organization requires that the developer of [Assignment: organization-defined information
system, system component, or information system service]:
Have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned [Assignment: organization-defined
official government duties]; and
Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria].
Supplemental Guidance: Because the information system, system component, or information system service
may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security interests of the
United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree
b. Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-247
of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the
information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening
criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of
developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the
company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or
services being developed. Related controls: PS-3, PS-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) DEVELOPER SCREENING | VALIDATION OF SCREENING
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service
take [Assignment: organization-defined actions] to ensure that the required access authorizations and screening
criteria are satisfied.
Supplemental Guidance: Satisfying required access authorizations and personnel screening criteria
includes, for example, providing a listing of all the individuals authorized to perform development
activities on the selected information system, system component, or information system service so that
organizations can validate that the developer has satisfied the necessary authorization and screening
requirements.
References: None.
a. b. SA-22 UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS
Control: The organization:
Replaces information system components when support for the components is no longer available from
the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and
Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of unsupported system
components required to satisfy mission/business needs.
Supplemental Guidance: Support for information system components includes, for example, software
patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported components (e.g.,
when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for
adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components. Exceptions to
replacing unsupported system components may include, for example, systems that provide critical
mission/business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated
that installing replacement components is not an option. Related controls: PL-2, SA-3.
SA-22 is not a CNSSI 1253 baseline control, but is required to be implemented for all SAP
systems. This control is non-tailorable for all SAP systems.
Control Enhancements:
(1) UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS | ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT
The organization provides [Selection (one or more): in-house support; [Assignment: organization-defined support
from external providers]] for unsupported information system components.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the need to provide continued support for
selected information system components that are no longer supported by the original developers,
vendors, or manufacturers when such components remain essential to mission/business operations.
Organizations can establish in-house support, for example, by developing customized patches for
critical software components or secure the services of external providers who through contractual
relationships, provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components. Such contractual
relationships can include, for example, Open Source Software value-added vendors.

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION CONTROLS
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES
With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that
organizations have such capability, this publication provides a set of security controls in the System
and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the development of
information systems, information technology products, and information system services. Therefore,
many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and
services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the security controls in the
SA family includes all system/component/service development and the developers associated with
such development whether the development is conducted by internal organizational personnel or by
external developers through the contracting/acquisition process. Affected controls include SA-8, SA-
10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.
Chapter 3-SA PAGE 3-249
FAMILY: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
SC-1 a. 2. b. 1. SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A system and communications protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and communications protection policy
and associated system and communications protection controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
System and communications protection policy at least annually if not otherwise defined in
formal organizational policy; and
System and communications protection procedures at least annually if not otherwise defined in
formal organizational policy.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
2. DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to system and communications protection
are defined in the remainder of this section.
Control Enhancements: None.

SC-2 APPLICATION PARTITIONING
Control: The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services) from
information system management functionality.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions
necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires
privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information system management
functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation of system management-
related functionality from user functionality by using different computers, different central processing
units, different instances of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or
combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes, for example, web
administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system
resources. Separation of system and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on
different domains and with additional access controls. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SC-3.
Control Enhancements:
(1) APPLICATION PARTITIONING | INTERFACES FOR NON-PRIVILEGED USERS
The information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related functionality at an
interface for non-privileged users.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement ensures that administration options (e.g.,
administrator privileges) are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of the grey-
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-250
out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). Such restrictions include, for
example, not presenting administration options until users establish sessions with administrator
privileges. Related control: AC-3.
References: None.
SC-3 SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION
Control: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.
Supplemental Guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by
means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). Such isolation controls access to
and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions.
Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity
functions) in a number of ways, including, for example, through the provision of security kernels via
processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved
through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk, and address space protections that
protect executing code. Information systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access
control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the code
within the security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes
necessary to include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. Related controls:
AC-3, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-13, SC-2, SC-7, SC-39.
Security function isolation includes, but is not limited to, audit daemons, host-based
firewalls, anti-virus or filtering functions, and account management.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION
The information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement security function isolation.
Supplemental Guidance: Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example, hardware
ring architectures, commonly implemented within microprocessors, and hardware-enforced address
segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate attributes (i.e., readable,
writeable).
SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | ACCESS / FLOW CONTROL FUNCTIONS
The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control from nonsecurity
functions and from other security functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the functions
can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated from access and
flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion detection, and anti-virus
functions.
SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MINIMIZE NONSECURITY FUNCTIONALITY
The organization minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation boundary containing
security functions.
Supplemental Guidance: In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of
nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the
nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions contained
within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or maliciousness in such
software, by virtue of being within the boundary, can impact the security functions of organizational
information systems. The design objective is that the specific portions of information systems
providing information security are of minimal size/complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity
functions in the security-relevant components of information systems allows designers and
implementers to focus only on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired security
capability (typically access enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation
boundaries, the amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus
contributing to understandability.
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-251
(4) (5) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MODULE COUPLING AND COHESIVENESS
The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that maximize internal cohesiveness
within modules and minimize coupling between modules.
Supplemental Guidance: The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security functions
and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important with respect to
modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one module has on other
modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different functions within a particular
module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular decomposition, layering, and
minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing software modules that are highly
cohesive and loosely coupled.
SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | LAYERED STRUCTURES
The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions between layers of the
design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.
Supplemental Guidance: The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions among
security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on higher-layer
functions) further enables the isolation of security functions and management of complexity.
References: None.
SC-4 INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES
Control: The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared
system resources.
Supplemental Guidance: This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of
information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of
prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to
shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released
back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to
as object reuse and residual information protection. This control does not address: (i) information
remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been nominally erased or removed; (ii)
covert channels (including storage and/or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to
violate information flow restrictions; or (iii) components within information systems for which there are
only single users/roles. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, MP-6.
See PE-5 for KVM guidance.
Control Enhancements:
(1) INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES | SECURITY LEVELS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-4].
(2) INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES | PERIODS PROCESSING
The information system prevents unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with
[Assignment: organization-defined procedures] when system processing explicitly switches between different
information classification levels or security categories.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies when there are explicit changes in
information processing levels during information system operations, for example, during multilevel
processing and periods processing with information at different classification levels or security
categories. Organization-defined procedures may include, for example, approved sanitization processes
for electronically stored information.
References: None.
SC-5 DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION
Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of denial of
service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or reference to source
for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-252
Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of
denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to
protect information system components on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by
denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy
may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | RESTRICT INTERNAL USERS
The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch [Assignment: organization-defined denial of
service attacks] against other information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks requires
that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable. Individuals of concern can include, for
example, hostile insiders or external adversaries that have successfully breached the information
system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third parties. Organizations
can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary information on the transport
medium (i.e., network, wireless spectrum). Organizations can also limit the ability of individuals to use
excessive information system resources. Protection against individuals having the ability to launch
denial of service attacks may be implemented on specific information systems or on boundary devices
prohibiting egress to potential target systems.
DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | EXCESS CAPACITY / BANDWIDTH / REDUNDANCY
The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects of information
flooding denial of service attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to
counter flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected
usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.
DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | DETECTION / MONITORING
The organization:
(a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring tools] to detect indicators of denial of service attacks
against the information system; and
(b) Monitors [Assignment: organization-defined information system resources] to determine if sufficient resources
exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system resources
when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial of service attacks can
originate from external or internal sources. Information system resources sensitive to denial of service
include, for example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Common safeguards to prevent
denial of service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity include, for example, instituting disk
quotas, configuring information systems to automatically alert administrators when specific storage
capacity thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to maximize available storage
space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user data. Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.
References: None.
SC-6 RESOURCE AVAILABILITY
Control: The information system protects the availability of resources by allocating [Assignment:
organization-defined resources] by [Selection (one or more); priority; quota; [Assignment: organization-
defined security safeguards]].
Supplemental Guidance: Priority protection helps prevent lower-priority processes from delaying or
interfering with the information system servicing any higher-priority processes. Quotas prevent users or
processes from obtaining more than predetermined amounts of resources. This control does not apply to
information system components for which there are only single users/roles.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-253
a. b. c. SC-7 BOUNDARY PROTECTION
Control: The information system:
Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal
boundaries within the system;
Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically;
logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and
Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of
boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.
Supplemental Guidance: Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards,
network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented
within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on
protected subnetworks). Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are
referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational
information systems includes, for example, restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within
managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses.
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation
of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are
commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached
commercial customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements.
Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
Related controls: AC-4, AC-17, CA-3, CM-7, CP-8, IR-4, RA-3, SC-5, SC-13.
This requirement also applies to ports, protocols, and services.
Information systems, in conjunction with the environment in which they are installed, shall:
• Provide for remote access only for an authorized, specific purpose (for example, to
provide email access for a guest agency’s employee via a VPN). The remote connection
must be restricted to approved purposes. Authorized remote access shall not enable the
user to communicate as an extension of the IS or to communicate with local resources
such as a printer or file server unless explicitly authorized by the AO.
• Route specific internal communications traffic through authenticated proxy servers
within the managed interfaces of boundary protection devices, (e.g., as defined in DoDI
8551.1, Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM), and DISA STIGs), to
external networks (i.e., networks outside the control of the organization). The list of
traffic to be routed through managed interfaces may be augmented with service/agency
or site-specific requirements and approved by the AO or designee.
• Use private/non-publicly routable IP addresses for isolated LANs.
• Host-based boundary protection mechanisms shall be employed on mobile devices, (e.g.,
notebook/laptop computers and other types of mobile devices) where boundary
protection mechanisms are available. This typically applies when your internal network
has classification or access levels that differ.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PHYSICALLY SEPARATED SUBNETWORKS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7].
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PUBLIC ACCESS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7].
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ACCESS POINTS
The organization limits the number of external network connections to the information system.
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-254
(4) (e) (5) (6) (7) (8) Supplemental Guidance: Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more
comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet
Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the number of external network connections.
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
The organization:
(a) (b) (c) (d) Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;
Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;
Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;
Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need and duration of
that need; and
Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and removes
exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-8.
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DENY BY DEFAULT / ALLOW BY EXCEPTION
The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default and allows network
communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound network
communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy
ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are allowed.
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESPONSE TO RECOGNIZED FAILURES
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7 (18)].
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES
The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents the device from simultaneously establishing
non-remote connections with the system and communicating via some other connection to resources in external
networks.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g., notebook
computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices, and by preventing
those configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This control enhancement is
implemented within the information system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration
settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote
device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with
local information system resources such as printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would in
effect allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to
exfiltration of organizational information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately
provisioned with appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance
that it can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and
integrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications paths from
remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need for preventing
split tunneling.
BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AUTHENTICATED PROXY SERVERS
The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic] to [Assignment:
organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces.
Supplemental Guidance: External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy
server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients
requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or services) from other
organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial connection to the proxy server are
evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity.
Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers providing access to the
Internet. Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and
blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and
unauthorized websites. Related controls: AC-3, AU-2.
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-255
(9) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
The information system:
(a) Detects and denies outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external information systems; and
(b) Audits the identity of internal users associated with denied communications.
Supplemental Guidance: Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that may pose
threats to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection. Extrusion detection at
information system boundaries as part of managed interfaces includes the analysis of incoming and
outgoing communications traffic searching for indications of internal threats to the security of external
systems. Such threats include, for example, traffic indicative of denial of service attacks and traffic
containing malicious code. Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.
(10) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED EXFILTRATION
The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.
Supplemental Guidance: Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized exfiltration
of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict adherence to protocol formats;
(ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems; (iii) monitoring for steganography; (iv)
disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly needed; (v) disassembling and
reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the
volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or call backs to command and control centers.
Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol formats include, for example, deep packet inspection
firewalls and XML gateways. These devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specification at
the application layer and serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating
at the network or transport layers. This control enhancement is closely associated with cross-domain
solutions and system guards enforcing information flow requirements. Related control: SI-3.
(11) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment: organization-defined authorized
sources] routed to [Assignment: organization-defined authorized destinations].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides determinations that source and destination
address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations can be based on
several factors including, for example, the presence of source/destination address pairs in lists of
authorized/allowed communications, the absence of address pairs in lists of unauthorized/disallowed
pairs, or meeting more general rules for authorized/allowed source/destination pairs. Related control:
AC-3.
(12) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | HOST-BASED PROTECTION
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection mechanisms] at
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, host-based
firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary protection mechanisms
include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices.
(13) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF SECURITY TOOLS / MECHANISMS / SUPPORT COMPONENTS
The organization isolates [at a minimum, vulnerability scanning tools, audit log servers, patch servers, and CND tools
] from other internal information system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks with
managed interfaces to other components of the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful, for
example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to
prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of organizations. Related
controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.
(14) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PROTECTS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS
The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at any managed interface that crosses
security domains or connects to an external network; such as but not limited to: cross domain solutions, a
network boundary with a WAN, a partner network, or the Internet.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems operating at different security categories or classification
levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the systems may share space
within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these separate information systems may
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-256
share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths. Protection against
unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for example, by employing clearly identified and
physically separated cable trays, connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed
interfaces with physical access controls enforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related
controls: PE-4, PE-19.
Reference also SC-8.
(15) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE PRIVILEGED NETWORK ACCESSES
The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed interface for
purposes of access control and auditing.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AU-2, SI-4.
(16) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT DISCOVERY OF COMPONENTS / DEVICES
The information system prevents discovery of specific system components composing a managed interface.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects network addresses of information system
components that are part of managed interfaces from discovery through common tools and techniques
used to identify devices on networks. Network addresses are not available for discovery (e.g., network
address not published or entered in domain name systems), requiring prior knowledge for access.
Another obfuscation technique is to periodically change network addresses.
(17) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT OF PROTOCOL FORMATS
The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components that enforce protocol formats include, for
example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. Such system components verify
adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and identify
significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport
layers. Related control: SC-4.
(18) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | FAIL SECURE
The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary protection device.
Supplemental Guidance: Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing information system
mechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices at
managed interfaces (e.g., routers, firewalls, guards, and application gateways residing on protected
subnetworks commonly referred to as demilitarized zones), information systems do not enter into
unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Failures of boundary protection
devices cannot lead to, or cause information external to the devices to enter the devices, nor can
failures permit unauthorized information releases. Related controls: CP-2, SC-24.
(19) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | BLOCKS COMMUNICATION FROM NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY CONFIGURED HOSTS
The information system blocks both inbound and outbound communications traffic between [Assignment:
organization-defined communication clients] that are independently configured by end users and external service
providers.
Supplemental Guidance: Communication clients independently configured by end users and external
service providers include, for example, instant messaging clients. Traffic blocking does not apply to
communication clients that are configured by organizations to perform authorized functions.
(20) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DYNAMIC ISOLATION / SEGREGATION
The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] from other components of the system.
Supplemental Guidance: The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal components
of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition or separate certain
components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater trustworthiness. Component
isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information systems. Isolation of selected
information system components is also a means of limiting the damage from successful cyber attacks
when those attacks occur.
(21) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] supporting [Assignment: organization-defined missions and/or business functions].
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-257
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can isolate information system components performing different
missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among
system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected
components. Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the
capability for increased protection of individual components and to more effectively control
information flows between those components. This type of enhanced protection limits the potential
harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation provided varies depending upon the
mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, routers, gateways, and
firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks, cross-
domain devices separating subnetworks, virtualization techniques, and encrypting information flows
among system components using distinct encryption keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.
(22) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | SEPARATE SUBNETS FOR CONNECTING TO DIFFERENT SECURITY DOMAINS
The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect to systems in
different security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide the
appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains containing
information with different security categories or classification levels.
(23) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DISABLE SENDER FEEDBACK ON PROTOCOL VALIDATION FAILURE
The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.
Supplemental Guidance: Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol validation
format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be unavailable.
References: FIPS Publication 199; NIST Special Publications 800-41, 800-77.
SC-8 TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY
Control: The information system protects the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of
information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices,
notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the
physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.
Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by
physical means (e.g., by employing protected distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing
encryption techniques). Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as
commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to
individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the
implementation of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations,
organizations determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard,
commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary
security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,
organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the additional risk.
Related controls: AC-17, PE-4.
This control prevents information from being modified at data aggregation or protocol
transformation points, compromising the integrity of the information.
Data traversing a network at a lower classification level shall be protected using NSA Type-1
encryption. See DoDI 8523.01, Communications Security (COMSEC), for additional
information regarding the protection of information during transmission.
When more than one computer network exists within a SAPF, a color coding scheme shall be
developed to assist in the proper handling of classified information. Color coding of cables
may be met by any of the following:
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-258
• Purchasing/making cables with the proper color.
• Placing colored tape every five feet along the cable length.
• Wrapping tape around the length of the cable run.
Table 3-3 provides a standard color scheme for typical non-SAP networks and shall not be
used for SAP networks without AO or PSO approval. Additionally, cables processing
information at the same classification level shall be bundled together in an orderly manner.
All cabling must meet TEMPEST requirements.
Classification/Compartment/
Color
Handling Caveat
TS//SCI Yellow
TS//US Only Orange
S//US Only Red
U//FOUO Green
Table 3-4: Network Cable Color Coding Scheme
When networks are present other than those listed in Table 3-3, a different color must be
selected for the network cables to assist in minimizing the risk to classified information
systems. This includes SAP networks, even though they are associated with a specific
classification level. Colors chosen should be in sharp contrast to colors already in use to
easily ascertain the associated network in low light areas/conditions. The following
systems/networks are examples of such situations where a different color, other than those
specified in Table 3-3, must be selected:
• TS//SCI//SAR
• TS//SAR
• S//SAR
• Coalition/Releasable networks

Control Enhancements:
(1) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC OR ALTERNATE PHYSICAL PROTECTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, and detect
changes to, information during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards such
as keeping transmission within physical areas rated IAW the sensitivity of the information or within a
Protected Distribution System (PDS) when traversing areas not approved for the sensitivity of the
information.
Supplemental Guidance: Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized
disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity
include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common application in digital
signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. Alternative physical security safeguards
include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related control: SC-13.
Transmission confidentiality applies not only to classified information, but to sensitive
unclassified as well. This includes, but is not limited to, such information as PII,
HVSACO, CUI, and FOUO. A protected distribution system (PDS) provides physical
protection for communications lines and can also provide need-to-know isolation. A
PDS must be used to transmit unencrypted classified information through an area of
lesser classification or control. For additional information, and where NIST referenced

(2) (3) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | PRE / POST TRANSMISSION HANDLING
The information system maintains the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of information during
preparation for transmission and during reception.
Supplemental Guidance: Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified
during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for example, during aggregation, at
protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or
modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information. Related control: AU-10.
TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION FOR MESSAGE EXTERNALS
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals unless otherwise
protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized disclosure
of information. Message externals include, for example, message headers/routing information. This
control enhancement prevents the exploitation of message externals and applies to both internal and
external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized users.
Header/routing information is sometimes transmitted unencrypted because the information is not
properly identified by organizations as having significant value or because encrypting the information
can result in lower network performance and/or higher costs. Alternative physical safeguards include,
for example, protected distribution systems. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CONCEAL / RANDOMIZE COMMUNICATIONS
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize communication patterns
unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized disclosure
of information. Communication patterns include, for example, frequency, periods, amount, and
predictability. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information having intelligence value
especially when combined with other available information related to missions/business functions
supported by organizational information systems. This control enhancement prevents the derivation of
intelligence based on communications patterns and applies to both internal and external networks or
links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and
transmitting in continuous, fixed/random patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the
system communications patterns. Alternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected
distribution systems. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.

(4) SC-10 NETWORK DISCONNECT
Control: The information system terminates the network connection associated with a communications
session at the end of the session or after no more than one (1) hour of inactivity.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating network
connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated
TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the
application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network
connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include, for example, time
periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.
Control Enhancements: None.

SC-11 TRUSTED PATH
Control: The information system establishes a trusted communications path between the user and the
following security functions of the system: [Assignment: organization-defined security functions to include
at a minimum, information system authentication and re-authentication].
Supplemental Guidance: Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can
communicate directly with security functions of information systems with the requisite assurance to support
information security policies. The mechanisms can be activated only by users or the security functions of
organizational information systems. User responses via trusted paths are protected from modifications by or
disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted paths for high-assurance connections
between security functions of information systems and users (e.g., during system logons). Enforcement of
trusted communications paths is typically provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor
concept. Related controls: AC-16, AC-25.
Control Enhancements:
(1) TRUSTED PATH | LOGICAL ISOLATION
The information system provides a trusted communications path that is logically isolated and distinguishable from
other paths.
References: None.
SC-12 CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys for required cryptography employed
within the information system in accordance with NSA-approved key management technology and
processes.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual
procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define key
management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and guidance, specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters.
Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are in such trust stores. This
includes certificates with visibility external to organizational information systems and certificates related to
the internal operations of systems. Related controls: SC-13, SC-17.
Cryptographic keys include, but are not limited to those associated with bulk encryptors (e.g.,
NSA-provided cryptographic equipment), PKI, and FIPS 140-2 approved encryption
modules, and may be implemented via either hardware or software. In addition,
organizations shall maintain availability of information, via key escrow, in the event of the
loss of cryptographic keys.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT | AVAILABILITY
The organization maintains availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.
Supplemental Guidance: Escrowing of encryption keys is a common practice for ensuring availability in
the event of loss of keys (e.g., due to forgotten passphrase).

SC-13 CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
Control: The information system implements NSA-approved cryptography for protecting classified
information from access by personnel who lack the necessary security clearance in accordance with
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions including,
for example, the protection of classified and Controlled Unclassified Information, the provision of digital
signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary
clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be
used to support random number generation and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic
standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not
impose any requirements on organizations to use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required based
on the selection of other security controls, organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type
of cryptography required (e.g., protection of classified information: NSA-approved cryptography; provision
of digital signatures: FIPS-validated cryptography). Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-17, AC-18,

NIST FIPS-compliant cryptography shall be used to protect controlled unclassified
information (CUI). To protect classified information and U//HVSACO, see SC-8
for transmission and SC-28 for information at rest.
For information systems with an integrity impact level of moderate or high, FIPS-validated
(e.g., FIPS 140-2) or NSA-approved cryptography shall be used, as appropriate, to
implement digital signatures. This capability may be provided via either hardware or
software.

a. SC-15 COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES
Control: The information system:
Prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions:
[Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed]; and
Provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.
Supplemental Guidance: Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white boards,
cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to users when
collaborative computing devices are activated. Related control: AC-21.
b. Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-262
Collaborative computing devices include, but are not limited to, VTC, VoIP telephones,
VVoIP, networked white boards, video cameras, and microphones. All collaborative
computing devices must be approved by the AO prior to purchase. In addition, all
collaborative computing equipment, whether connected to SAP, collateral, or unclassified
information systems or networks located in SAPFs must be approved by the PSO prior to
introduction into the facility. Collaborative computing devices connecting to unclassified
information systems within SAPFs are not recommended.
Any multi-classification collaborative computing devices, VTC or like systems that have
video and/or audio capability integrated into one system must be previously evaluated by the
appropriate Service SAP CTTA.
Collaborative Computing Device Use
The following requirements apply to the use of all collaborative computing devices,
regardless of whether they are used on SCI, SAP, collateral classified, or unclassified
networks or systems.
• Collaborative computing devices shall not be remotely activated –no exceptions, nor
may they invoke auto-answer capabilities that automatically activate the video and
audio recording/transmitting devices. [SC-15.a] Activation of collaborative
computing devices requires an explicit action by the user (e.g., in the case of a VTC,
the user is required to explicitly turn on the camera, speaker, and microphone) and an
explicit indication that the equipment is in use and active. [SC-15.b] Remote
activation of a camera or microphone is prohibited, i.e., the auto-answer feature shall
be disabled.
• Collaborative computing devices that provide video and/or audio conference
capabilities shall provide a clearly visible indication that the video and audio
mechanisms are operating to alert personnel in the facility when a collaborative
computing session is in progress.
• Camera lenses shall be covered with an opaque covering when the camera is not in
use. No systems, documents, or media of higher classification may be displayed or
in view of the camera.
• Microphones must have a mute or hold capability (e.g., on/off switch) and should
have a push-to-talk button (implemented in hardware or software) when the
sensitivity of the collaborative session and environments can differ.
• While conducting a collaborative computing session, users shall take all reasonable
measures to ensure that no unintended information is made audible or visible via the
collaborative computing device. Users shall advise all personnel in the immediate
area that the collaborative computing device will be operating and shall sanitize all
sensitive material/systems that may be in view of the collaborative computing
device.
• Users shall not leave the collaborative computing device unattended while a session
is in progress. Once the collaborative session is completed, the user shall take
explicit action to disconnect/terminate the collaborative computing device.
In addition to the above, the following additional requirements apply to all collaborative
computing devices used on collateral classified or unclassified networks or systems:
• Desktop level collaborative computing devices may use external loud
speakers/amplified sound only if they are installed within a closed room with walls
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-263
that meet the requirement of the PSO, otherwise a headset must be used.
• Microphones must be used in such a way to ensure no unintended conversations are
picked up and transmitted outside the facility. This may be accomplished by using
microphones in enclosed offices, or by ensuring no other higher classified
discussions occur in the area when the microphone is in use.
• Personnel within the facility shall be notified when a camera or microphone is in use.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES | PHYSICAL DISCONNECT
The information system provides physical disconnect of collaborative computing devices in a manner that supports
ease of use.
Supplemental Guidance: Failing to physically disconnect from collaborative computing devices can
result in subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods to physically
disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session helps to ensure that participants
actually carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through complex and tedious
procedures.
COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES | BLOCKING INBOUND / OUTBOUND COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7].
COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES | DISABLING / REMOVAL IN SECURE WORK AREAS
The organization disables or removes collaborative computing devices from [Assignment: organization-defined
information systems or information system components] in [Assignment: organization-defined secure work areas].
Supplemental Guidance: Failing to disable or remove collaborative computing devices from information
systems or information system components can result in subsequent compromises of organizational
information including, for example, eavesdropping on conversations.
COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES | EXPLICITLY INDICATE CURRENT PARTICIPANTS
The information system provides an explicit indication of current participants in [Assignment: organization-defined
online meetings and teleconferences].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement helps to prevent unauthorized individuals from
participating in collaborative computing sessions without the explicit knowledge of other participants.
References: None.
SC-16 TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY ATTRIBUTES
Control: The information system associates [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] with
information exchanged between information systems and between system components.
Supplemental Guidance: Security attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated with the information
contained in organizational information systems or system components. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-
16.
Control Enhancements:
(1) TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | INTEGRITY VALIDATION
The information system validates the integrity of transmitted security attributes.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement ensures that the verification of the integrity of
transmitted information includes security attributes. Related controls: AU-10, SC-8.
References: None.
SC-17 PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATES
Control: The organization issues public key certificates under an [Assignment: organization-defined
certificate policy] or obtains public key certificates from an approved service provider.
Supplemental Guidance: For all certificates, organizations manage information system trust stores to ensure
only approved trust anchors are in the trust stores. This control addresses both certificates with visibility

SC-18 MOBILE CODE
Control: The organization:
Defines acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies;
Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for acceptable mobile code and mobile
code technologies; and
Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of mobile code within the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational
information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used
maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF,
Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance
apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and
executed on individual workstations and devices (e.g., smart phones). Mobile code policy and procedures
address preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within
organizational information systems. Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, CM-2, CM-6, SI-3.
Mobile code is software obtained from remote systems outside the system authorization
boundary, transferred across a network, and then downloaded and executed on a local system
(e.g., a computer with a web browser) without explicit installation or execution by the
recipient. ‘Transferred across a network’ includes transfers via media, aka sneakernet.
SC-18 is addressed at the highest level by indicating the use or prohibition of mobile code.
Mobile code is frequently used even on isolated LANs by the software used to manage
systems, e.g., ePolicy orchestrator (the HBSS management tool) uses JAVA for loading its
management console; other software may use .Net Framework. sdf
The risks to closed restricted networks and isolated LANs are vastly different than the Global
Information Grid (GIG) therefore the mitigations required to address (b) and (c) statements
of the control as well as the enhancements should be vastly easier to outline and enumerate.
Potential options for indicating how this control is implemented may include one of the
following examples:
• The following are the acceptable uses of mobile code within the system:
(List known web services on the system that utilize mobile code)
HBSS Management website: Java.
• The HBSS Management console is DAC’d to sysadmin/IA users only.
• Requests for new mobile code is restricted and must be approved IAW the software
approval process (Other than new development this is the most likely way to
introduce new mobile code to an isolated network. On systems where mobile code
or other software is being developed, typically there is a software approval process
that discusses how development is done on the system and how integrity of code and
subsequent code libraries is verified.)
Mobile code technologies are software technologies that provide the mechanisms for the
production and use of mobile code. Mobile code technologies include, but are not limited to,
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-265
Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, .NET, Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and
VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and
use of mobile code installed on organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and
executed on individual workstations. Policy and procedures related to mobile code address
preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within
the information system.
DoD SAP policies define three risk categories for mobile code. Following a thorough risk
assessment, each mobile code technology is assigned to one of three risk categories:
• Category 1 (High Risk): These mobile code technologies provide broad
functionality, allowing unmediated access to workstation, host, and remote system
services and resources. Category 1 mobile code technologies have known security
vulnerabilities with few or no countermeasures once they begin executing. They
pose a severe threat to DoD SAP operations, and the high risk associated with their
use outweighs almost all possible benefits.
• Category 2 (Medium Risk): These mobile code technologies have full
functionality, allowing mediated or controlled access to workstation, host, and
remote system services and resources. They also have known fine-grained, periodic,
or continuous countermeasures or safeguards against security exploits. Category 2
technologies pose a moderate threat to DoD SAP information systems; when
combined with prudent countermeasures against malicious code and exploitation,
their use can afford benefits that generally outweigh the risks.
• Category 3 (Low Risk): These mobile code technologies provide limited
functionality with no capability for unmediated access to workstation, host, and
remote system resources and services, and they have fine-grained, periodic, or
continuous security safeguards against security exploits. Category 3 technologies are
of limited risk to DoD SAP systems. When combined with vigilance comparable to
that required to keep any software system configured to resist known exploits, the
use of Category 3 technologies affords benefits that generally outweigh the risks.
Organizations shall comply with mobile code requirements, usage restrictions, and
implementation guidance for acceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies as
follows [SC-18.a and .b]:
• Emerging mobile code technologies, that have not undergone a risk assessment and
been assigned to a Risk Category by the AO, shall not be used.
• Category 1 mobile code shall be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. Use of
unsigned Category 1 mobile code is prohibited. Use of Category 1 mobile code
technologies that cannot block or disable unsigned mobile code (e.g., Windows
Scripting Host) is prohibited.
• Category 2 mobile code which executes in a constrained environment without access
to system resources (e.g., Windows registry, file system, system parameters, and
network connections to other than the originating host) may be used.
• Category 2 mobile code which does not execute in a constrained environment may
be used when obtained from a trusted source over an assured channel (e.g., JWICS,
SIPRNet, SSL connection, S/MIME) or when signed with an approved certificate.
• Category 3 mobile code may be used.
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-266
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) MOBILE CODE | IDENTIFY UNACCEPTABLE CODE / TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The information system identifies [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile code] and takes
[Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions].
Supplemental Guidance: Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include, for
example, blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes, for example, preventing
transmission of word processing files with embedded macros when such macros have been defined to
be unacceptable mobile code.
MOBILE CODE | ACQUISITION / DEVELOPMENT / USE
The organization ensures that the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code to be deployed in the
information system meets [Assignment: organization-defined mobile code requirements].
MOBILE CODE | PREVENT DOWNLOADING / EXECUTION
The information system prevents the download and execution of [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable
mobile code].
MOBILE CODE | PREVENT AUTOMATIC EXECUTION
The information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in [Assignment: organization-defined
software applications] and enforces [Assignment: organization-defined actions] prior to executing the code.
Supplemental Guidance: Actions enforced before executing mobile code, include, for example,
prompting users prior to opening electronic mail attachments. Preventing automatic execution of
mobile code includes, for example, disabling auto execute features on information system components
employing portable storage devices such as Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Video Disks (DVDs), and
Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices.
MOBILE CODE | ALLOW EXECUTION ONLY IN CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS
The organization allows execution of permitted mobile code only in confined virtual machine environments.

a. SC-19 VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL
Control: The organization:
Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously; and
Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of VoIP within the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-6, SC-7, SC-15.
b. Organizations shall ensure VoIP technologies are implemented with AO and PSO approval.
Additional guidance is available in the DISA Voice and Video Over IP (VVoIP) STIG. In
addition, the following shall apply:
• VoIP telephone instruments shall have a “Consent to Monitor” label (e.g., DD Form
2056) or banner and an appropriate classification label or banner. Example of
unclassified label below:
Figure 3-3: ‘Consent to Monitor’ Label
VoIP telephone instruments must be used in such a way to ensure no unintended
conversations are picked up and transmitted outside the facility. This may include use in an
enclosed office, or ensuring no other higher classified discussions occur in the area when the
VoIP telephone is in use.

SC-20 a. b. SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)
Control: The information system:
Provides additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the
authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution
queries; and
Provides the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure
resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when
operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enables external clients including, for example, remote Internet clients,
to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network
address resolution information obtained through the service. Information systems that provide name and
address resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. Additional artifacts
include, for example, DNS Security (DNSSEC) digital signatures and cryptographic keys. DNS resource
records are examples of authoritative data. The means to indicate the security status of child zones includes,
for example, the use of delegation signer resource records in the DNS. The DNS security controls reflect
(and are referenced from) OMB Memorandum 08-23. Information systems that use technologies other than
the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to assure the
authenticity and integrity of response data. Related controls: AU-10, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-21, SC-22.
A Domain Name System (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides
name/address resolution service.
An example is indication of the security status of child subspaces through the use of

SC-21 SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (RECURSIVE OR CACHING RESOLVER)
Control: The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity
verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.
Supplemental Guidance: Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own, or
has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Information systems that provide name and
address resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or caching domain
name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or
clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. Information systems
that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses
provide other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data. Related
controls: SC-20, SC-22.

SC-22 ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME/ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE
Control: The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an
organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal/external role separation.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for
example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance
redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers, one configured
as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations
typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the
same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address
resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles
only process name and address resolution information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e.,
on external networks including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative
DNS servers in particular roles (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists). Related controls: SC-2, SC-20, SC-
21, SC-24.

SC-23 SESSION AUTHENTICITY
Control: The information system protects the authenticity of communications sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses communications protection at the session, versus packet level
(e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services) and establishes grounds for
confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the
validity of information transmitted. Authenticity protection includes, for example, protecting against man-
in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions. Related
controls: SC-8, SC-10, SC-11.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) SESSION AUTHENTICITY | INVALIDATE SESSION IDENTIFIERS AT LOGOUT
The information system invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from capturing and
continuing to employ previously valid session IDs.
SESSION AUTHENTICITY | USER-INITIATED LOGOUTS / MESSAGE DISPLAYS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-12 (1)].
SESSION AUTHENTICITY | UNIQUE SESSION IDENTIFIERS WITH RANDOMIZATION
The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session with [Assignment: no readily
reproducible or ‘spoofable’ session identifiers] and recognizes only session identifiers that are system-generated.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from reusing
previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session
identifiers helps to protect against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers. Related
control: SC-13.
SESSION AUTHENTICITY | UNIQUE SESSION IDENTIFIERS WITH RANDOMIZATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-23 (3)].
SESSION AUTHENTICITY | ALLOWED CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES
The information system only allows the use of [Assignment: organization-defined certificate authorities] for
verification of the establishment of protected sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: Reliance on certificate authorities (CAs) for the establishment of secure
sessions includes, for example, the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or Transport Layer Security
(TLS) certificates. These certificates, after verification by the respective certificate authorities,
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-269
facilitate the establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web servers. Related control:

SC-24 FAIL IN KNOWN STATE
Control: The information system fails to a [Assignment: organization-defined known-state] for
[Assignment: organization-defined types of failures] preserving [Assignment: organization-defined system
state information] in failure.
Supplemental Guidance: Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the
mission/business needs of organizations. Failure in a known secure state helps to prevent the loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational information
systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from failing to a
state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving information system state
information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of organizations with less
disruption of mission/business processes. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10, CP-12, SC-7, SC-22.
Control Enhancements: None.

SC-25 THIN NODES
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] with
minimal functionality and information storage.
Supplemental Guidance: The deployment of information system components with reduced/minimal
functionality (e.g., diskless nodes and thin client technologies) reduces the need to secure every user
endpoint, and may reduce the exposure of information, information systems, and services to cyber attacks.
Related control: SC-30.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SC-26 HONEYPOTS
Control: The information system includes components specifically designed to be the target of malicious
attacks for the purpose of detecting, deflecting, and analyzing such attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: A honeypot is set up as a decoy to attract adversaries and to deflect their attacks
away from the operational systems supporting organizational missions/business function. Depending upon
the specific usage of the honeypot, consultation with the Office of the General Counsel before deployment
may be needed. Related controls: SC-30, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.
Control Enhancements: None.

SC-27 PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT APPLICATIONS
Control: The information system includes: [Assignment: organization-defined platform-independent
applications].
Supplemental Guidance: Platforms are combinations of hardware and software used to run software
applications. Platforms include: (i) operating systems; (ii) the underlying computer architectures, or (iii)
both. Platform-independent applications are applications that run on multiple platforms. Such applications
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-270
promote portability and reconstitution on different platforms, increasing the availability of critical functions
within organizations while information systems with specific operating systems are under attack. Related
control: SC-29.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SC-28 PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST
Control: The information system protects the confidentiality and integrity of all SAP information at rest.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest and
covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when
it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information
requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion
detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ
different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of
cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by
implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. Organizations may also employ other
security controls including, for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify
malicious code at rest. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, PE-3, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3,
SI-7.
Encryption shall be implemented to complement protection of information at rest, using
approved cryptographic methods identified in SC-13. Reference [MP-5] for data encryption
as well as media transport requirements, i.e., mobile devices and removable media.
Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a non-volatile
device (e.g., hard drive, tapes, optical discs, flash drives). This also includes workstations,
servers, and off-line storage.
This control is non-tailorable for all SAP systems.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification
of [Assignment: organization-defined information] on [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components].
Supplemental Guidance: Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is
commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. This control
enhancement applies to significant concentrations of digital media in organizational areas designated
for media storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with information system
components in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices, mobile devices).
Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk
encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields). Organizations employing
cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at rest also consider cryptographic key management
solutions. Related controls: AC-19, SC-12.
In addition, all portable media originating from an IS which has a high or moderate
confidentiality rating shall be encrypted using either NSA approved, or FIPS 140-2
compliant products, see [MP-5(4)].
(2) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST | OFF-LINE STORAGE
The organization removes from online storage and stores off-line in a secure location [Assignment: organization-
defined information].
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-271
Supplemental Guidance: Removing organizational information from online information system storage
to off-line storage eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized access to the
information through a network. Therefore, organizations may choose to move information to off-line
storage in lieu of protecting such information in online storage.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-56, 800-57, 800-111.
SC-29 HETEROGENEITY
Control: The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for [Assignment: organization-
defined information system components] in the implementation of the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational
information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also defends
against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in
information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one
information system component will be equally effective against other system components, thus further
increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned cyber attacks. An increase in
diversity may add complexity and management overhead which could ultimately lead to mistakes and
unauthorized configurations. Related controls: SA-12, SA-14, SC-27.
Control Enhancements:
(1) HETEROGENEITY | VIRTUALIZATION TECHNIQUES
The organization employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of operating systems and
applications that are changed [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
Supplemental Guidance: While frequent changes to operating systems and applications pose
configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for
adversaries in order to carry out successful cyber attacks. Changing virtual operating systems or
applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems/applications, provide virtual changes
that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. In addition,
virtualization techniques can assist organizations in isolating untrustworthy software and/or software
of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.
References: None.
SC-30 CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined concealment and misdirection
techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] at [Assignment: organization-
defined time periods] to confuse and mislead adversaries.
Supplemental Guidance: Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting
capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete
cyber attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise
information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having
multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection techniques including, for example,
randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and
subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection
techniques may also provide organizations additional time to successfully perform core missions and
business functions. Because of the time and effort required to support concealment/misdirection techniques,
it is anticipated that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis. Related
controls: SC-26, SC-29, SI-14.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-29 (1)].
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-272
(2) (3) (4) (5) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | RANDOMNESS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to introduce randomness into
organizational operations and assets.
Supplemental Guidance: Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries
regarding the actions organizations take in defending against cyber attacks. Such actions may impede
the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations supporting critical
missions/business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating or
continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness include, for example, performing
certain routine actions at different times of day, employing different information technologies (e.g.,
browsers, search engines), using different suppliers, and rotating roles and responsibilities of
organizational personnel.
CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING / STORAGE LOCATIONS
The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined processing and/or storage] [Selection:
[Assignment: organization-defined time frequency]; at random time intervals]].
Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions and the
information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time, trying to
minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature
of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible to
cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing organizational processing
and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced
persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication.
This enables organizations to relocate the information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage)
supporting critical missions and business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or
storage sites introduces uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty
increases the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational
information systems much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that
adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical
organizational resources.
CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION
The organization employs realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organization-defined information
system components] with regard to its security state or posture.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding the nature
and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result, adversaries may employ
incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques. One way of misleading adversaries is for
organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific security controls deployed in
external information systems that are known to be accessed or targeted by adversaries. Another
technique is the use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized environments) that mimic actual
aspects of organizational information systems but use, for example, out-of-date software
configurations.
CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to hide or conceal [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: By hiding, disguising, or otherwise concealing critical information system
components, organizations may be able to decrease the probability that adversaries target and
successfully compromise those assets. Potential means for organizations to hide and/or conceal
information system components include, for example, configuration of routers or the use of honeynets
or virtualization techniques.

SC-31 COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS
Control: The organization:
Performs a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the information
system that are potential avenues for covert [Selection (one or more): storage; timing] channels; and
a. Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-273
(1) (2) b. Estimates the maximum bandwidth of those channels.
Supplemental Guidance: Developers are in the best position to identify potential areas within systems that
might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the potential
for unauthorized information flows across security domains, for example, in the case of information
systems containing export-controlled information and having connections to external networks (i.e.,
networks not controlled by organizations). Covert channel analysis is also meaningful for multilevel secure
(MLS) information systems, multiple security level (MSL) systems, and cross-domain systems. Related
controls: AC-3, AC-4, PL-2.
Control Enhancements:
COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS | TEST COVERT CHANNELS FOR EXPLOITABILITY
The organization tests a subset of the identified covert channels to determine which channels are exploitable.
COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS | MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH
The organization reduces the maximum bandwidth for identified covert [Selection (one or more); storage; timing]
channels to [Assignment: organization-defined values].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system developers are in the best position to reduce the maximum
bandwidth for identified covert storage and timing channels.
COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS | MEASURE BANDWIDTH IN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS
The organization measures the bandwidth of [Assignment: organization-defined subset of identified covert channels]
in the operational environment of the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses covert channel bandwidth in operational
environments versus developmental environments. Measuring covert channel bandwidth in operational
environments helps organizations to determine how much information can be covertly leaked before
such leakage adversely affects organizational missions/business functions. Covert channel bandwidth
may be significantly different when measured in those settings that are independent of the particular
environments of operation (e.g., laboratories or development environments).
References: None.
(3) SC-32 INFORMATION SYSTEM PARTITIONING
Control: The organization partitions the information system into [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] residing in separate physical domains or environments based on
[Assignment: organization-defined circumstances for physical separation of components].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system partitioning is a part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy.
Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components from physically distinct
components in separate racks in the same room, to components in separate rooms for the more critical
components, to more significant geographical separation of the most critical components. Security
categorization can guide the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. Managed
interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned information system
components. Related controls: AC-4, SA-8, SC-2, SC-3, SC-7.
Control Enhancements: None.

SC-34 NON-MODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS
Control: The information system at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]:
Loads and executes the operating environment from hardware-enforced, read-only media; and
a. Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-274
b. (1) Loads and executes [Assignment: organization-defined applications] from hardware-enforced, read-
only media.
Supplemental Guidance: The term operating environment is defined as the specific code that hosts
applications, for example, operating systems, executives, or monitors including virtual machine monitors
(i.e., hypervisors). It can also include certain applications running directly on hardware platforms.
Hardware-enforced, read-only media include, for example, Compact Disk-Recordable (CD-R)/Digital
Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R) disk drives and one-time programmable read-only memory. The use of
non-modifiable storage ensures the integrity of software from the point of creation of the read-only image.
The use of reprogrammable read-only memory can be accepted as read-only media provided: (i) integrity
can be adequately protected from the point of initial writing to the insertion of the memory into the
information system; and (ii) there are reliable hardware protections against reprogramming the memory
while installed in organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-3, SI-7.
Control Enhancements:
NON-MODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS | NO WRITABLE STORAGE
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] with no writeable
storage that is persistent across component restart or power on/off.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement: (i) eliminates the possibility of malicious code
insertion via persistent, writeable storage within the designated information system components; and
(ii) applies to both fixed and removable storage, with the latter being addressed directly or as specific
restrictions imposed through access controls for mobile devices. Related controls: AC-19, MP-7.
NON-MODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS | INTEGRITY PROTECTION / READ-ONLY MEDIA
The organization protects the integrity of information prior to storage on read-only media and controls the media after
such information has been recorded onto the media.
Supplemental Guidance: Security safeguards prevent the substitution of media into information systems
or the reprogramming of programmable read-only media prior to installation into the systems. Security
safeguards include, for example, a combination of prevention, detection, and response. Related
controls: AC-5, CM-3, CM-5, CM-9, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, SA-12, SC-28, SI-3.
NON-MODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS | HARDWARE-BASED PROTECTION
The organization:
(a) Employs hardware-based, write-protect for [Assignment: organization-defined information system firmware
components]; and
(b) Implements specific procedures for [Assignment: organization-defined authorized individuals] to manually
disable hardware write-protect for firmware modifications and re-enable the write-protect prior to returning to
operational mode.
References: None.
(2) (3) SC-35 HONEYCLIENTS
Control: The information system includes components that proactively seek to identify malicious websites
and/or web-based malicious code.
Supplemental Guidance: Honeyclients differ from honeypots in that the components actively probe the
Internet in search of malicious code (e.g., worms) contained on external websites. As with honeypots,
honeyclients require some supporting isolation measures (e.g., virtualization) to ensure that any malicious
code discovered during the search and subsequently executed does not infect organizational information
systems. Related controls: SC-26, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SC-36 DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE
Control: The organization distributes [Assignment: organization-defined processing and storage] across
multiple physical locations.
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-275
Supplemental Guidance: Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations provides
some degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations, and therefore increases the work factor of
adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, and individuals. This control does not
assume a single primary processing or storage location, and thus allows for parallel processing and storage.
Related controls: CP-6, CP-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE | POLLING TECHNIQUES
The organization employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to [Assignment:
organization-defined distributed processing and storage components].
Supplemental Guidance: Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce opportunities
for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information
and information systems. However, distribution of processing and/or storage components does not
prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of the distributed components. Polling compares
the processing results and/or storage content from the various distributed components and subsequently
voting on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, errors, or compromises in distributed
processing and/or storage components. Related control: SI-4.
References: None.
SC-37 OUT-OF-BAND CHANNELS
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band channels] for the
physical delivery or electronic transmission of [Assignment: organization-defined information, information
system components, or devices] to [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or information systems].
Supplemental Guidance: Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork) accesses to
information systems, network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational traffic, or
nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the same channels (i.e., in-
band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same
vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band channels. Organizations may
employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many organizational items including, for
example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or
software, cryptographic key management information, security updates, system/data backups, maintenance
information, and malicious code protection updates. Related controls: AC-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-7, IA-4,
IA-5, MA-4, SC-12, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) OUT-OF-BAND CHANNELS | ENSURE DELIVERY / TRANSMISSION
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that only [Assignment:
organization-defined individuals or information systems] receive the [Assignment: organization-defined information,
information system components, or devices].
Supplemental Guidance: Techniques and/or methods employed by organizations to ensure that only
designated information systems or individuals receive particular information, system components, or
devices include, for example, sending authenticators via courier service but requiring recipients to
show some form of government-issued photographic identification as a condition of receipt.
References: None.
SC-38 OPERATIONS SECURITY
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security safeguards] to
protect key organizational information throughout the system development life cycle.
Supplemental Guidance: Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential adversaries
can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by identifying, controlling,
and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of
sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five steps: (i) identification of critical
Chapter 3-SC PAGE 3-276
information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii) analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of
vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC
safeguards are applied to both organizational information systems and the environments in which those
systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect the confidentiality of key information including, for
example, limiting the sharing of information with suppliers and potential suppliers of information system
components, information technology products and services, and with other non-organizational elements and
individuals. Information critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element
uses, suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications,
testing protocols, and security control implementation details. Related controls: RA-2, RA-5, SA-12.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SC-39 PROCESS ISOLATION
Control: The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each executing process.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing
process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information system process has a distinct
address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the
security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining
separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing
separate address spaces. This capability is available in most commercial operating systems that employ
multi-state processor technologies. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.
Use of a modern operating system meets this control for most systems.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) PROCESS ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION
The information system implements underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process separation.
Supplemental Guidance: Hardware-based separation of information system processes is generally less
susceptible to compromise than software-based separation, thus providing greater assurance that the
separation will be enforced. Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example,
hardware memory management.
PROCESS ISOLATION | THREAD ISOLATION
The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each thread in [Assignment: organization-defined
multi-threaded processing].
References: None.
SC-40 WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION
Control: The information system protects external and internal [Assignment: organization-defined wireless
links] from [Assignment: organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources
for such attacks].
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links that may
be visible to individuals who are not authorized information system users. Adversaries can exploit the
signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to
exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or to spoof users of
organizational information systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless
systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity
items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement this control. Related
controls: AC-18, SC-5.

Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [Assignment: organization-defined level
of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects against intentional jamming that might deny
or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-
jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The control enhancement may also
coincidentally help to mitigate the effects of unintentional jamming due to interference from legitimate
transmitters sharing the same spectrum. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations,
and applicable legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine levels
of wireless link availability and performance/cryptography needed. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | REDUCE DETECTION POTENTIAL
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential of wireless links to
[Assignment: organization-defined level of reduction].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is needed for covert communications and protecting
wireless transmitters from being geo-located by their transmissions. The control enhancement ensures
that spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve low probability of detection are not predictable by
unauthorized individuals. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and
applicable legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine the levels to
which wireless links should be undetectable. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | IMITATIVE OR MANIPULATIVE COMMUNICATIONS DECEPTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless transmissions that are
deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement ensures that the signal parameters of wireless
transmissions are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Such unpredictability reduces the
probability of imitative or manipulative communications deception based upon signal parameters
alone. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | SIGNAL PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of [Assignment:
organization-defined wireless transmitters] by using the transmitter signal parameters.
Supplemental Guidance: Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal parameters of
transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and mission/user identification.
This control enhancement protects against the unique identification of wireless transmitters for
purposes of intelligence exploitation by ensuring that anti-fingerprinting alterations to signal
parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. This control enhancement helps assure
mission success when anonymity is required. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.

SC-41 PORT AND I/O DEVICE ACCESS
Control: The organization physically disables or removes [Assignment: organization-defined connection
ports or input/output devices] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or information
system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Connection ports include, for example, Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Firewire
(IEEE 1394). Input/output (I/O) devices include, for example, Compact Disk (CD) and Digital Video Disk
(DVD) drives. Physically disabling or removing such connection ports and I/O devices helps prevent
exfiltration of information from information systems and the introduction of malicious code into systems
from those ports/devices.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. b. SC-42 SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA
Control: The information system:
Prohibits the remote activation of environmental sensing capabilities with the following exceptions:
[Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation of sensors is allowed]; and
Provides an explicit indication of sensor use to [Assignment: organization-defined class of users].
Supplemental Guidance: This control often applies to types of information systems or system components
characterized as mobile devices, for example, smart phones, tablets, and E-readers. These systems often
include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where the system is in use.
Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include, for example, cameras, microphones, Global
Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors on mobiles devices provide
an important function, if activated covertly, such devices can potentially provide a means for adversaries to
learn valuable information about individuals and organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS
function on a mobile device could provide an adversary with the ability to track the specific movements of
an individual.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | REPORTING TO AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS OR ROLES
The organization ensures that the information system is configured so that data or information collected by
the [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only reported to authorized individuals or roles.
Supplemental Guidance: In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals (e.g., end
users), it is still possible that the data/information collected by the sensors will be sent to unauthorized
entities.
SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | AUTHORIZED USE
The organization employs the following measures: [Assignment: organization-defined measures], so that data or
information collected by [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only used for authorized purposes.
Supplemental Guidance: Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose potentially
could be misused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that are used to support
traffic navigation could be misused to track movements of individuals. Measures to mitigate such
activities include, for example, additional training to ensure that authorized parties do not abuse their
authority, or (in the case where sensor data/information is maintained by external parties) contractual
restrictions on the use of the data/information.
SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | PROHIBIT USE OF DEVICES
The organization prohibits the use of devices possessing [Assignment: organization-defined environmental sensing
capabilities] in [Assignment: organization-defined facilities, areas, or systems].
Supplemental Guidance: For example, organizations may prohibit individuals from bringing cell phones
or digital cameras into certain facilities or specific controlled areas within facilities where classified
information is stored or sensitive conversations are taking place.
References: None.
a. SC-43 USAGE RESTRICTIONS
Control: The organization:
Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if
used maliciously; and
Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of such components within the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components include hardware, software, or firmware
components (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, mobile code, digital copiers, printers, scanners, optical
devices, wireless technologies, mobile devices). Related controls: CM-6, SC-7.

Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SC-44 DETONATION CHAMBERS
Control: The organization employs a detonation chamber capability within [Assignment: organization-
defined information system, system component, or location].
Supplemental Guidance: Detonation chambers, also known as dynamic execution environments, allow
organizations to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and execute
Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests in the safety of an isolated environment or virtualized sandbox.
These protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of determining whether the
associated attachments/applications contain malicious code. While related to the concept of deception nets,
the control is not intended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their
actions can be observed. Rather, it is intended to quickly identify malicious code and reduce the likelihood
that the code is propagated to user environments of operation (or prevent such propagation completely).
Related controls: SC-7, SC-25, SC-26, SC-30.
Control Enhancements: None.

FAMILY: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
SI-1 a. 2. b. SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
1. A system and information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and information integrity policy and
associated system and information integrity controls; and
Reviews and updates the current:
System and information integrity policy at least annually; and
System and information integrity procedures at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SI family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
1. 2. DoD SAP-policy and procedures related to system and information integrity are defined in
the remainder of this section.

a. b. c. d. SI-2 FLAW REMEDIATION
Control: The organization:
Identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws;
Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side
effects before installation;
Installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within thirty (30) days of the release of the
updates; and
Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software flaws
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated
organizational personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates
include, for example, patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address
flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and
system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws
discovered in organizational information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing
configuration management processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified.
Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether
organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-
defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-281
factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the
update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation
may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed
for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and also the types of changes that are
to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software
and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple anti-virus
signature updates. Organizations may also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software
or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures. Related
controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-8, MA-2, IR-4, RA-5, SA-10, SA-11, SI-11.
Flaw remediation refers to software patch management. Patch management is the systematic
notification, identification, deployment, installation, and verification of operating system and
application software code revisions.
Organizations shall:
• Ensure system/network administrators routinely review vendor sites, bulletins, and
notifications and proactively update information systems with fixes, patches,
definitions, service packs, or implementation of vulnerability mitigation strategies
with ISSM approval.
• Employ automated patch management tools on all components to the maximum
extent supported by available tools to facilitate flaw remediation.
PM-14 is another related control.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) FLAW REMEDIATION | CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
The organization centrally manages the flaw remediation process.
Supplemental Guidance: Central management is the organization-wide management and implementation
of flaw remediation processes. Central management includes planning, implementing, assessing,
authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed flaw remediation security
controls.
FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED FLAW REMEDIATION STATUS
The organization employs automated mechanisms at least once a quarter to determine the state of information
system components with regard to flaw remediation.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-6, SI-4.
FLAW REMEDIATION | TIME TO REMEDIATE FLAWS / BENCHMARKS FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The organization:
(a) Measures the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation; and
(b) Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined benchmarks] for taking corrective actions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires organizations to determine the current time
it takes on the average to correct information system flaws after such flaws have been identified, and
subsequently establish organizational benchmarks (i.e., time frames) for taking corrective actions.
Benchmarks can be established by type of flaw and/or severity of the potential vulnerability if the flaw
can be exploited.
Historical benchmarks, if available, can be used as a reference point for comparison.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-2].
FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE UPDATES
The organization installs [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant software and firmware updates]
automatically to [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Due to information system integrity and availability concerns, organizations
give careful consideration to the methodology used to carry out automatic updates. Organizations must
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-282
(6) balance the need to ensure that the updates are installed as soon as possible with the need to maintain
configuration management and with any mission or operational impacts that automatic updates might
impose.
FLAW REMEDIATION | REMOVAL OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE
The organization removes [Assignment: organization-defined software and firmware components] after updated
versions have been installed.
Supplemental Guidance: Previous versions of software and/or firmware components that are not
removed from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited by
adversaries. Some information technology products may remove older versions of software and/or
firmware automatically from the information system.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-40, 800-128.
a. b. c. 2. d. SI-3 MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION
Control: The organization:
Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect
and eradicate malicious code;
Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in accordance
with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;
Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:
1. Perform periodic scans of the information system at least weekly and real-time scans of files from
external sources at endpoints and network entry/exit points as the files are downloaded, opened,
or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and
Block and quarantine malicious code then send an alert to the system administrator;
[Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code detection; and
Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the
resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic
mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, notebook computers, and
mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware.
Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within
compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by
different means including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and
portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of information system
vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions
and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the
effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-
shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for
example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational
missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such
code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including, for example, secure
coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended.
Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be
warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during
periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to
detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files. Related controls: CM-3, MP-2, SA-4,
SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SC-7, SC-26, SC-44, SI-2, SI-4, SI-7.
In reference to SI-3.b, malicious code protection mechanisms shall be updated, at a
minimum, every 30 days.
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-283
Control Enhancements:
(1) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
The organization centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Central management is the organization-wide management and implementation
of malicious code protection mechanisms. Central management includes planning, implementing,
assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed flaw malicious
code protection security controls. Related controls: AU-2, SI-8.
Central management of malicious code protection includes client/server antivirus model,
records of malicious code protection updates; information system configuration settings
and associated documentation.
(2) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | AUTOMATIC UPDATES
The information system automatically updates malicious code protection mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, signature
definitions. Due to information system integrity and availability concerns, organizations give careful
consideration to the methodology used to carry out automatic updates. Related control: SI-8.
Information systems shall automatically update malicious code protection mechanisms
(including signature definitions), i.e., after updates are installed to the server.
(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | NON-PRIVILEGED USERS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6 (10)].
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | UPDATES ONLY BY PRIVILEGED USERS
The information system updates malicious code protection mechanisms only when directed by a privileged user.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement may be appropriate for situations where for reasons
of security or operational continuity, updates are only applied when selected/approved by designated
organizational personnel. Related controls: AC-6, CM-5.
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-7].
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | TESTING / VERIFICATION
The organization:
(a) Tests malicious code protection mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] by introducing a
known benign, non-spreading test case into the information system; and
(b) Verifies that both detection of the test case and associated incident reporting occur.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, RA-5.
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | NONSIGNATURE-BASED DETECTION
The information system implements nonsignature-based malicious code detection mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include, for example, the use of
heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to
provide safeguards against malicious code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing
signatures may not be effective. This includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes
signatures when it replicates). This control enhancement does not preclude the use of signature-based
detection mechanisms.
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | DETECT UNAUTHORIZED COMMANDS
The information system detects [Assignment: organization-defined unauthorized operating system commands]
through the kernel application programming interface at [Assignment: organization-defined information system
hardware components] and audits the command execution and prevents the execution of the command.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement can also be applied to critical interfaces other than
kernel-based interfaces, including for example, interfaces with virtual machines and privileged
applications. Unauthorized operating system commands include, for example, commands for kernel
functions from information system processes that are not trusted to initiate such commands, or
commands for kernel functions that are suspicious even though commands of that type are reasonable
for processes to initiate. Organizations can define the malicious commands to be detected by a
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-284
(9) (10) combination of command types, command classes, or specific instances of commands. Organizations
can define hardware components by specific component, component type, location in the network, or
combination therein. Organizations may select different actions for different types/classes/specific
instances of potentially malicious commands. Related control: AU-6.
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | AUTHENTICATE REMOTE COMMANDS
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to authenticate
[Assignment: organization-defined remote commands].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects against unauthorized commands and replay
of authorized commands. This capability is important for those remote information systems whose
loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation would have immediate and/or serious consequences
(e.g., injury or death, property damage, loss of high-valued assets or sensitive information, or failure of
important missions/business functions). Authentication safeguards for remote commands help to
ensure that information systems accept and execute in the order intended, only authorized commands,
and that unauthorized commands are rejected. Cryptographic mechanisms can be employed, for
example, to authenticate remote commands. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13, SC-23.
MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | MALICIOUS CODE ANALYSIS
The organization:
(a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and techniques] to analyze the characteristics and behavior of
malicious code; and
(b) Incorporates the results from malicious code analysis into organizational incident response and flaw
remediation processes.
Supplemental Guidance: The application of selected malicious code analysis tools and techniques
provides organizations with a more in-depth understanding of adversary tradecraft (i.e., tactics,
techniques, and procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific instances of malicious code.
Understanding the characteristics of malicious code facilitates more effective organizational responses
to current and future threats. Organizations can conduct malicious code analyses by using reverse
engineering techniques or by monitoring the behavior of executing code.
Malicious code analysis is frequently conducted by a trained forensics team.

a. b. SI-4 INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING
Control: The organization:
Monitors the information system to detect:
1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined
monitoring objectives]; and
2. Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections;
Identifies unauthorized use of the information system through [Assignment: organization-defined
techniques and methods];
Deploys monitoring devices: (i) strategically within the information system to collect organization-
determined essential information; and (ii) at ad hoc locations within the system to track specific types
of transactions of interest to the organization;
Protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized access, modification,
and deletion;
Heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of
increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation
based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of
information;
c. d. e. Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-285
f. g. Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance with
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations; and
Provides [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring information] to
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more): as needed;
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External
monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of
perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events
occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by
observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns,
characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the
events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques
(e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software,
scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for
monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting
critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with
controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security
can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on
organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives.
Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic
that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous
monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous
monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that
communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any
connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network,
and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-

Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | SYSTEM-WIDE INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
The organization connects and configures individual intrusion detection tools into an information system-wide
intrusion detection system.
INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED TOOLS FOR REAL-TIME ANALYSIS
The organization employs automated tools to support near real-time analysis of events.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated tools include, for example, host-based, network-based, transport-
based, or storage-based event monitoring tools or Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) technologies that provide real time analysis of alerts and/or notifications generated by
organizational information systems.
INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED TOOL INTEGRATION
The organization employs automated tools to integrate intrusion detection tools into access control and flow control
mechanisms for rapid response to attacks by enabling reconfiguration of these mechanisms in support of attack
isolation and elimination.
INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INBOUND AND OUTBOUND COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications traffic continuously for unusual or
unauthorized activities or conditions.
Supplemental Guidance: Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to information system
inbound and outbound communications traffic include, for example, internal traffic that indicates the
presence of malicious code within organizational information systems or propagating among system
components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling to external information systems.
Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised information systems or
information system components.
INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | SYSTEM-GENERATED ALERTS
The information system alerts Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] when the following indications of
compromise or potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined compromise indicators].
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-286
Supplemental Guidance: Alerts may be generated from a variety of sources, including, for example, audit
records or inputs from malicious code protection mechanisms, intrusion detection or prevention
mechanisms, or boundary protection devices such as firewalls, gateways, and routers. Alerts can be
transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging.
Organizational personnel on the notification list can include, for example, system administrators,
mission/business owners, system owners, or information system security officers. Related controls:
AU-5, PE-6.
System alerts may be sent to the system administrator, ISSO, ISSM for indicators related
to audit records, alerts from malicious code detection mechanisms, intrusion detection or
prevention mechanisms, boundary protection mechanisms such as firewalls, gateways,
and routers.
(6) (7) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | RESTRICT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6 (10)].
INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED RESPONSE TO SUSPICIOUS EVENTS
The information system notifies [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name
and/or by role)] of detected suspicious events and takes [Assignment: organization-defined least-disruptive actions to
terminate suspicious events].
Supplemental Guidance: Least-disruptive actions may include, for example, initiating requests for human
responses.
The least disruptive action is appropriately determined for each individual system.
Notification may equate to an email notification to a system administrator, who must
then contact incident response personnel within their command chain.
(8) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROTECTION OF MONITORING INFORMATION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].
(9) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | TESTING OF MONITORING TOOLS
The organization tests intrusion-monitoring tools at least monthly.
Supplemental Guidance: Testing intrusion-monitoring tools is necessary to ensure that the tools are
operating correctly and continue to meet the monitoring objectives of organizations. The frequency of
testing depends on the types of tools used by organizations and methods of deployment. Related
control: CP-9.
(10) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | VISIBILITY OF ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS
The organization makes provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined encrypted communications traffic] is
visible to [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring tools].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations balance the potentially conflicting needs for encrypting
communications traffic and for having insight into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. For
some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications traffic is paramount; for
others, mission-assurance is of greater concern. Organizations determine whether the visibility
requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or
a subset of the traffic types.
(11) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ANOMALIES
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the information system and
selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems)] to
discover anomalies.
Supplemental Guidance: Anomalies within organizational information systems include, for example,
large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in use, and attempted
communications with suspected malicious external addresses.
(12) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED ALERTS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following inappropriate or
unusual activities with security implications: at a minimum including unauthorized access attempts,
unauthorized system usage.
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-287
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on the security alerts generated by
organizations and transmitted using automated means. In contrast to the alerts generated by
information systems in SI-4 (5), which tend to focus on information sources internal to the systems
(e.g., audit records), the sources of information for this enhancement can include other entities as well
(e.g., suspicious activity reports, reports on potential insider threats). Related controls: AC-18, IA-3.
Organizations will list alerts that their monitoring software is configured to provide. E-
mail or security dashboard alerts meet the intent of this control and can be set up to
summarize user unauthorized access attempts to files or authentication failures.
(13) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / EVENT PATTERNS
The organization:
(14) (a) Analyzes communications traffic/event patterns for the information system;
(b) Develops profiles representing common traffic patterns and/or events; and
(c) Uses the traffic/event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices to reduce the number of false positives and
the number of false negatives.
INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS INTRUSION DETECTION
The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect
attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines of organization-controlled
facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections including the
conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Scans are not limited to those areas
within facilities containing information systems, but also include areas outside of facilities as needed,
to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to the systems. Related controls:
AC-18, IA-3.
Organizations should proactively monitor for unauthorized wireless connections,
including scanning for unauthorized wireless access points at least quarterly.
Unauthorized wireless devices require reporting and response in accordance with the
organization / system incident response plan.
(15) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS TO WIRELINE COMMUNICATIONS
The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications traffic as the traffic
passes from wireless to wireline networks.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-18.
(16) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | CORRELATE MONITORING INFORMATION
The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed throughout the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Correlating information from different monitoring tools can provide a more
comprehensive view of information system activity. The correlation of monitoring tools that usually
work in isolation (e.g., host monitoring, network monitoring, anti-virus software) can provide an
organization-wide view and in so doing, may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding
the capabilities/limitations of diverse monitoring tools and how to maximize the utility of information
generated by those tools can help organizations to build, operate, and maintain effective monitoring
programs. Related control: AU-6.
(17) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INTEGRATED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
The organization correlates information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to achieve
integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement correlates monitoring information from a more
diverse set of information sources to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational
awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the
capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated cyber attacks and investigate the
methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to SI-4 (16) which correlates
the various cyber monitoring information, this control enhancement correlates monitoring beyond just
the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across
multiple attack vectors. Related control: SA-12.
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-288
(18) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / COVERT EXFILTRATION
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the information system (i.e.,
system perimeter) and at [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the system (e.g., subsystems,
subnetworks)] to detect covert exfiltration of information.
Supplemental Guidance: Covert means that can be used for the unauthorized exfiltration of
organizational information include, for example, steganography.
(19) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INDIVIDUALS POSING GREATER RISK
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of individuals who have been
identified by [Assignment: organization-defined sources] as posing an increased level of risk.
Supplemental Guidance: Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from a variety of
sources including, for example, human resource records, intelligence agencies, law enforcement
organizations, and/or other credible sources. The monitoring of individuals is closely coordinated with
management, legal, security, and human resources officials within organizations conducting such
monitoring and complies with federal legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations,
and standards.
(20) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PRIVILEGED USER
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of privileged users.
Implementation of AU-2 controls may address this security control. Identify additional
monitoring activities required by the AO.
(21) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROBATIONARY PERIODS
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of individuals during
[Assignment: organization-defined probationary period].
Additional monitoring may be instituted as part of a new-user policy, upon notice of
personnel termination (e.g., user gives two weeks’ notice), or the result of incident
response. This control may be implemented and defined at the time of incident.
Example: Following an incident related to incorrect marking, the PSO/GSSO/CPSO
institutes probationary period of 30 days during which time a designated security person
reviews all documents produced by the individual.
(22) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | UNAUTHORIZED NETWORK SERVICES
The information system detects network services that have not been authorized or approved by [Assignment:
organization-defined authorization or approval processes] and [Selection (one or more): audits; alerts [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles]].
Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized or unapproved network services include, for example, services in
service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or validation and therefore may be
unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for valid services. Related controls: AC-6, CM-7, SA-5, SA-9.
(23) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | HOST-BASED DEVICES
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based monitoring mechanisms] at [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components where host-based monitoring can be
implemented include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. Organizations consider
employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple information technology product
developers.
This includes monitoring, for example, I/O and endpoint services, reference [AC-6(1)].
(24) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE
The information system discovers, collects, distributes, and uses indicators of compromise.
Supplemental Guidance: Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are
identified on organizational information systems (at the host or network level). IOCs provide
organizations with valuable information on objects or information systems that have been
compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example, the creation of
registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example, Universal Resource Locator (URL)
or protocol elements that indicate malware command and control servers. The rapid distribution and
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-289
adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that information systems and
organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack.

SI-5 a. b. c. SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES
Control: The organization:
Receives information system security alerts, advisories, and directives from includes, but is not
limited to, DHS US-CERT, SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC) and USCYBERCOM on an
ongoing basis;
Generates internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;
Disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to: ISOs, ISSM/ISSOs, system
administrators, and security personnel, as appropriate; [Assignment: organization-defined
elements within the organization]; [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations]]; and
Implements security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notifies the issuing
organization of the degree of noncompliance.
Supplemental Guidance: The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates
security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government. Security
directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to
issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of
these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely
manner. External organizations include, for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain
partners, external service providers, and other peer/supporting organizations. Related control: SI-2.
d. A variety of sites are available that provide warnings of system vulnerabilities or ongoing
attacks. The DoD Information Assurance Vulnerability (IAV) Management (IAVM) process
was created to develop and disseminate mitigating actions for critical software vulnerabilities
to DoD Components. US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and DISA jointly manage the
IAVM and Computer Network Directives, and both identify and publish vulnerabilities or
directives. IAVM notices have three levels of criticality:
• IAV Alert (IAVA) – most critical – a vulnerability posing an immediate and
potentially sever threat to DoD systems.
• IAV Bulletin (IAVB) – less critical than IAVA, but pose a threat to DoD systems.
• IAV Technical Advisory (IAVT) – less critical than IAVB.
IAVAs and IAVBs are maintained by USCYBERCOM and DISA.
Additional sources of alerts and advisories which may be monitored include:
• Department of Homeland Security (DHS) US Computer Emergency Readiness Team
(US-CERT).
• Military service computer security incident response teams (CSIRT) (i.e., Air Force
Network Operations and Security Center Network Security Division (AFNOSC
NSD), Army CERT – Computer Network Operations (ACERT-CNO), Navy Cyber
Defense Operations Command (NCDOC), and Marine Corps Network Operations
and Security Command (MCNOSC)).
• Advisories from the IC Security Coordination Center (IC-SCC) such as Intelligence
Community Vulnerability Alerts (ICVA) and Intelligence Community Vulnerability
Management (ICVM) releases.
• IAVAs and IAVBs maintained by USCYBERCOM and DISA.

(1) SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES | AUTOMATED ALERTS AND ADVISORIES
The organization employs automated mechanisms to make security alert and advisory information available
throughout the organization.
Supplemental Guidance: The significant number of changes to organizational information systems and
the environments in which those systems operate requires the dissemination of security-related
information to a variety of organizational entities that have a direct interest in the success of
organizational missions and business functions. Based on the information provided by the security
alerts and advisories, changes may be required at one or more of the three tiers related to the
management of information security risk including the governance level, mission/business
process/enterprise architecture level, and the information system level.

results include, for example, senior information security officers, information system security
managers, and information systems security officers. Related controls: SA-12, SI-4, SI-5.
References: None.
SI-7 SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
Control: The organization employs integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to
[Assignment: organization-defined software, firmware, and information].
Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to
errors or malicious activity (e.g., tampering). Software includes, for example, operating systems (with key
internal components such as kernels, drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware includes, for
example, the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Information includes metadata such as security attributes
associated with information. State-of-the-practice integrity-checking mechanisms (e.g., parity checks,
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-291
cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and associated tools can automatically monitor the
integrity of information systems and hosted applications. Related controls: SA-12, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3.
Integrity verification applications shall be employed on information systems to look for
evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions. Good software engineering
practices shall be employed with regard to COTS integrity mechanisms (e.g., parity checks,
cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes).
Organizations shall employ tracking systems software and associated documentation
protected by quantity licenses to control copying and distribution. For smaller systems, a
tracking system may be a simple spreadsheet. For more complex systems an automated
capability may be required.
Installation of software by users, including privileged users, is prohibited within the DoD
SAP Community unless done IAW with the process specifically approved by the AO.
Reference approved process outlined in CM-2, CM-2(4), and CM-2(5) and SI-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRITY CHECKS
The information system performs an integrity check of [Assignment: organization-defined software, firmware, and
information] [Selection (one or more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or security-
relevant events]; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant events include, for example, the identification of a new threat
to which organizational information systems are susceptible, and the installation of new hardware,
software, or firmware. Transitional states include, for example, system startup, restart, shutdown, and
abort.
SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | AUTOMATED NOTIFICATIONS OF INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS
The organization employs automated tools that provide notification to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
or roles] upon discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated tools to report integrity violations and to notify
organizational personnel in a timely matter is an essential precursor to effective risk response.
Personnel having an interest in integrity violations include, for example, mission/business owners,
information system owners, systems administrators, software developers, systems integrators, and
information security officers.
SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CENTRALLY-MANAGED INTEGRITY TOOLS
The organization employs centrally managed integrity verification tools.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-3, SI-2, SI-8.
SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | TAMPER-EVIDENT PACKAGING
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12].
SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | AUTOMATED RESPONSE TO INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS
The information system automatically [Selection (one or more): shuts the information system down; restarts the
information system; implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]] when integrity violations are
discovered.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may define different integrity checking and anomaly responses:
(i) by type of information (e.g., firmware, software, user data); (ii) by specific information (e.g., boot
firmware, boot firmware for a specific types of machines); or (iii) a combination of both. Automatic
implementation of specific safeguards within organizational information systems includes, for
example, reversing the changes, halting the information system, or triggering audit alerts when
unauthorized modifications to critical security files occur.
SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software,
firmware, and information.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include, for
example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-292
cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public
key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13.
(7) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRATION OF DETECTION AND RESPONSE
The organization incorporates the detection of unauthorized [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant
changes to the information system] into the organizational incident response capability.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement helps to ensure that detected events are tracked,
monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes. Maintaining historical records is important
both for being able to identify and discern adversary actions over an extended period of time and for
possible legal actions. Security-relevant changes include, for example, unauthorized changes to
established configuration settings or unauthorized elevation of information system privileges. Related
controls: IR-4, IR-5, SI-4.
(8) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | AUDITING CAPABILITY FOR SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity violation, provides the capability to audit the event and
initiates the following actions: [Selection (one or more): generates an audit record; alerts current user; alerts
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment: organization-defined other actions]].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific
software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations. Related controls: AU-2, AU-
6, AU-12.
(9) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | VERIFY BOOT PROCESS
The information system verifies the integrity of the boot process of all devices capable of verification of the boot
process.
Supplemental Guidance: Ensuring the integrity of boot processes is critical to starting devices in
known/trustworthy states. Integrity verification mechanisms provide organizational personnel with
assurance that only trusted code is executed during boot processes.
(10) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | PROTECTION OF BOOT FIRMWARE
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to protect the integrity of
boot firmware in [Assignment: organization-defined devices].
Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may be indicative of a
sophisticated, targeted cyber attack. These types of cyber attacks can result in a permanent denial of
service (e.g., if the firmware is corrupted) or a persistent malicious code presence (e.g., if code is
embedded within the firmware). Devices can protect the integrity of the boot firmware in
organizational information systems by: (i) verifying the integrity and authenticity of all updates to the
boot firmware prior to applying changes to the boot devices; and (ii) preventing unauthorized
processes from modifying the boot firmware.
(11) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS WITH LIMITED PRIVILEGES
The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed software] execute in a confined
physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations identify software that may be of greater concern with regard to
origin or potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user installations occur in
confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from malicious code that may be
executed.
(12) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires that the integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed software] be verified
prior to execution.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations verify the integrity of user-installed software prior to execution
to reduce the likelihood of executing malicious code or code that contains errors from unauthorized
modifications. Organizations consider the practicality of approaches to verifying software integrity
including, for example, availability of checksums of adequate trustworthiness from software
developers or vendors.
(13) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE EXECUTION IN PROTECTED ENVIRONMENTS
The organization allows execution of binary or machine-executable code obtained from sources with limited or no
warranty and without the provision of source code only in confined physical or virtual machine environments and with
the explicit approval of the Authorizing Official (AO).
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-293
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-
executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source software.
(14) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | BINARY OR MACHINE EXECUTABLE CODE
The organization:
(a) Prohibits the use of binary or machine-executable code from sources with limited or no warranty and without the
provision of source code; and
(b) Provides exceptions to the source code requirement only for compelling mission/operational requirements and
with the approval of the authorizing official.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-
executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source software.
Organizations assess software products without accompanying source code from sources with limited
or no warranty for potential security impacts. The assessments address the fact that these types of
software products may be very difficult to review, repair, or extend, given that organizations, in most
cases, do not have access to the original source code, and there may be no owners who could make
such repairs on behalf of organizations. Related control: SA-5.
Consider tailoring out if base control (SI-7) is not implemented.
(15) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE AUTHENTICATION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate all software and firmware from
vendors/sources that provide cryptographic mechanisms to enable the validation of code authenticity and
integrity prior to installation.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic authentication includes, for example, verifying that software or
firmware components have been digitally signed using certificates recognized and approved by
organizations. Code signing is an effective method to protect against malicious code.
(16) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | TIME LIMIT ON PROCESS EXECUTION W/O SUPERVISION
The organization does not allow processes to execute without supervision for more than [Assignment: organization-
defined time period].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses processes for which normal execution
periods can be determined and situations in which organizations exceed such periods. Supervision
includes, for example, operating system timers, automated responses, or manual oversight and
response when information system process anomalies occur.

a. b. SI-8 SPAM PROTECTION
Control: The organization:
Employs spam protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect and take
action on unsolicited messages; and
Updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in accordance with
organizational configuration management policy and procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic
mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, mobile devices, and
notebook/laptop computers. Spam can be transported by different means including, for example, electronic
mail, electronic mail attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection mechanisms include, for example,
signature definitions. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SPAM PROTECTION | CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
The organization centrally manages spam protection mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Central management is the organization-wide management and implementation
of spam protection mechanisms. Central management includes planning, implementing, assessing,
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-294
(2) (3) authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed spam protection security
controls. Related controls: AU-3, SI-2, SI-7.
SPAM PROTECTION | AUTOMATIC UPDATES
The information system automatically updates spam protection mechanisms.
SPAM PROTECTION | CONTINUOUS LEARNING CAPABILITY
The information system implements spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability to more effectively
identify legitimate communications traffic.
Supplemental Guidance: Learning mechanisms include, for example, Bayesian filters that respond to
user inputs identifying specific traffic as spam or legitimate by updating algorithm parameters and
thereby more accurately separating types of traffic.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-45.
SI-9 INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6].
SI-10 INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION
Control: The information system checks the validity of all inputs to web/application servers, database
servers, and any system or application input that might receive a crafted exploit toward executing
some code or buffer overflow.
Supplemental Guidance: Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g.,
character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified
definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use
structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system
components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or
control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages
without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special
characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the
module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise
interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from
being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs
and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.
Not all operating systems / applications provide input validation. The system configuration
documentation will address what inputs are checked and what input format and content is
acceptable.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (c) (2) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY
The information system:
(a) Provides a manual override capability for input validation of [Assignment: organization-defined inputs];
(b) Restricts the use of the manual override capability to only [Assignment: organization-defined authorized
individuals]; and
Audits the use of the manual override capability.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-3, CM-5.
INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / RESOLUTION OF ERRORS
The organization ensures that input validation errors are reviewed and resolved within [Assignment: organization-
defined time period].
Supplemental Guidance: Resolution of input validation errors includes, for example, correcting systemic
causes of errors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input.
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-295
(3) (4) (5) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR
The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system
objectives when invalid inputs are received.
Supplemental Guidance: A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is unpredictable
behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures that there is predictable
behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information system responses that facilitate
transitioning the system to known states without adverse, unintended side effects.
INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / TIMING INTERACTIONS
The organization accounts for timing interactions among information system components in determining appropriate
responses for invalid inputs.
Supplemental Guidance: In addressing invalid information system inputs received across protocol
interfaces, timing interfaces become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider the impact of the
error response on other protocols within the protocol stack. For example, 802.11 standard wireless
network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when packets are
dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet losses are due to
congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped due to collisions or noise on the
link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes precisely the wrong action in response to a collision
event. Adversaries may be able to use apparently acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in
concert to achieve adverse effects through suitable construction of invalid input.
INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | RESTRICT INPUTS TO TRUSTED SOURCES AND APPROVED FORMATS
The organization restricts the use of information inputs to [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources] and/or
[Assignment: organization-defined formats].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies the concept of whitelisting to information
inputs. Specifying known trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable formats for such inputs
can reduce the probability of malicious activity.
References: None.
a. b. SI-11 ERROR HANDLING
Control: The information system:
Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing
information that could be exploited by adversaries; and
Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent
to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational
policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for
example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business
information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal
information such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. In addition, error
messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information. Related controls: AU-2, AU-3, SC-
31.
Systems should be configured to reduce access to system errors and logs that could reveal
sensitive or security related information to adversaries to those personnel identified as
privileged users with a requirement to access such information.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-296
SI-12 INFORMATION HANDLING AND RETENTION
Control: The organization handles and retains information within the information system and information
output from the system in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, and operational requirements.
Supplemental Guidance: Information handling and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of
information, in some cases extending beyond the disposal of information systems. The National Archives
and Records Administration provides guidance on records retention. Related controls: AC-16, AU-5, AU-
11, MP-2, MP-4.
In the absence of AO specific guidance, National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) provide guidance on records retention.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
a. b. SI-13 PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION
Control: The organization:
Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components] in specific environments of operation; and
Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and standby
components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].
Supplemental Guidance: While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential failures
of specific information system components that provide security capability. Failure rates reflect
installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define criteria for substitution of
information system components based on MTTF value with consideration for resulting potential harm from
component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not
compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability (e.g., preservation of state variables).
Standby components remain available at all times except for maintenance issues or recovery failures in
progress. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10, MA-6.
The standby component shall mirror the primary system.
The organization develops this list of system components in support of availability
requirements that have been identified from the Business Impact Analysis or local policy.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) (3) (4) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | TRANSFERRING COMPONENT RESPONSIBILITIES
The organization takes information system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to
substitute components no later than [Assignment: organization-defined fraction or percentage] of mean time to
failure.
PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | TIME LIMIT ON PROCESS EXECUTION WITHOUT SUPERVISION
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-7 (16)].
PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | MANUAL TRANSFER BETWEEN COMPONENTS
The organization manually initiates transfers between active and standby information system components
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] if the mean time to failure exceeds [Assignment: organization-defined
time period].
PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | STANDBY COMPONENT INSTALLATION / NOTIFICATION
The organization, if information system component failures are detected:
(a) Ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within [Assignment:
organization-defined time period]; and
(b) [Selection (one or more): activates [Assignment: organization-defined alarm]; automatically shuts down the
information system].
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-297
(5) Supplemental Guidance: Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can
occur, for example, upon detection of component failures.
PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | FAILOVER CAPABILITY
The organization provides [Selection: real-time; near real-time] [Assignment: organization-defined failover capability]
for the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate information system
upon the failure of the primary information system. Failover capability includes, for example,
incorporating mirrored information system operations at alternate processing sites or periodic data
mirroring at regular intervals defined by recovery time periods of organizations.
References: None.
SI-14 NON-PERSISTENCE
Control: The organization implements non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components and services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated [Selection (one or more): upon
end of session of use; periodically at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].
Supplemental Guidance: This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by significantly
reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to
initiate and complete cyber attacks. By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected
information system components, organizations can provide a known state computing resource for a specific
period of time that does not give adversaries sufficient time on target to exploit vulnerabilities in
organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Since the
advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations
assume that over an extended period of time, a percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-
persistent information system components and services are activated as required using protected
information and terminated periodically or upon the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work
factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational information systems.
Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for example, by periodically re-imaging
components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be
implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on
physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic refreshes of information
system components/services is that it does not require organizations to first determine whether
compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult for
organizations to determine). The refresh of selected information system components and services occurs
with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency
that it makes the information system unstable. In some instances, refreshes of critical components and
services may be done periodically in order to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows
of vulnerabilities. Related controls: SC-30, SC-34.
Control Enhancements:
(1) NON-PERSISTENCE | REFRESH FROM TRUSTED SOURCES
The organization ensures that software and data employed during information system component and service
refreshes are obtained from [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources].
Supplemental Guidance: Trusted sources include, for example, software/data from write-once, read-only
media or from selected off-line secure storage facilities.
References: None.
SI-15 INFORMATION OUTPUT FILTERING
Control: The information system validates information output from [Assignment: organization-defined
software programs and/or applications] to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected
content.
Chapter 3-SI PAGE 3-298
Supplemental Guidance: Certain types of cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injections) produce output results that are
unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected from software programs
or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting extraneous content, preventing such
extraneous content from being displayed, and alerting monitoring tools that anomalous behavior has been
discovered. Related controls: SI-3, SI-4.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SI-16 MEMORY PROTECTION
Control: The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to
protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.
Supplemental Guidance: Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable
regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards employed to protect
memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data
execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware
providing the greater strength of mechanism. Related controls: AC-25, SC-3.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.
SI-17 FAIL-SAFE PROCEDURES
Control: The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined fail-safe procedures] when
[Assignment: organization-defined failure conditions occur].
Supplemental Guidance: Failure conditions include, for example, loss of communications among critical
system components or between system components and operational facilities. Fail-safe procedures include,
for example, alerting operator personnel and providing specific instructions on subsequent steps to take
(e.g., do nothing, reestablish system settings, shut down processes, restart the system, or contact designated
organizational personnel). Related controls: CP-12, CP-13, SC-24, SI-13.
Control Enhancements: None.

FAMILY: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
a. 2. 3. 4. b. c. d. PM-1 INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN
Control: The organization:
Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:
1. Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of the
security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting
those requirements;
Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects of
information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and
Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being incurred to
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan at least annually;
Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan
implementation or security control assessments; and
Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Supplemental Guidance: Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or
compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program
management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program plans
provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls (including
specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to
enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination
of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.
The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security
program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the
organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information security
program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g.,
security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary
protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide
information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of
common controls.
Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple
documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as
attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains
multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials
responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the
respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management
Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and
environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a
particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.
DoD SAP-specific policy and procedures related to program management controls are
defined in the remainder of this section with the goal to develop and disseminate an
organization-wide information security program. Reference the Defense Acquisition
Guidebook for ‘program security considerations’ and DoDM 5205.07, DoD SAP Security
Manual for additional guidance.

PM-4 a. b. PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES PROCESS
Control: The organization:
Implements a process for ensuring that plans of action and milestones for the security program and
associated organizational information systems:
1. Are developed and maintained;
2. Document the remedial information security actions to adequately respond to risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and
3. Are reported in accordance with OMB FISMA reporting requirements.
Reviews plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk management
strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.
Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information security
program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. With the increasing
emphasis on organization-wide risk management across all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy
Chapter 3-PM PAGE 3-301
(i.e., organization, mission/business process, and information system), organizations view plans of action
and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing risk response actions and ensuring
consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization. Plan of action and milestones updates are
based on findings from security control assessments and continuous monitoring activities. OMB FISMA
reporting guidance contains instructions regarding organizational plans of action and milestones. Related
control: CA-5.
Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) developed for authorization packages for
authorization [CA-5] of systems within the organization must be reviewed from an
organizational perspective, prioritizing risk response actions and ensuring consistency with
the goals and objectives of the organization.
Control Enhancements: None.

PM-5 INFORMATION SYSTEM INVENTORY
Control: The organization develops and maintains an inventory of its information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the inventory requirements in FISMA. OMB provides
guidance on developing information systems inventories and associated reporting requirements. For
specific information system inventory reporting requirements, organizations consult OMB annual FISMA
reporting guidance.
The SSP captures external information systems in proximity to the system under assessment,
i.e., within the accredited area. The organization’s information security program maintains
an inventory of information systems under its purview; ensuring information related to the
number, size, and mission of SAP information systems is maintained within SAP channels.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: Web: http://www.omb.gov.
PM-6 INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE
Control: The organization develops, monitors, and reports on the results of information security measures of
performance.
Supplemental Guidance: Measures of performance are outcome-based metrics used by an organization to
measure the effectiveness or efficiency of the information security program and the security controls
employed in support of the program.
As stated in NIST SP 800-55, Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security,
“Information security measures monitor the accomplishment of goals and objectives by
quantifying the implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness of security controls; analyzing
the adequacy of information security program activities; and identifying possible
improvement actions.”
Information security measurements are frequently captured as a percentage, e.g.:
• Percent of employees who received annual security awareness training.
• Percent of employees who received annual information assurance awareness training.
• Percent of information systems with approved system security plans.
Additional guidance on capturing measures of performance and suggested sources for items
that should be measured may be found in NIST SP 800-55.
Control Enhancements: None.

PM-7 ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
Control: The organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration for information security and
the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation.
Supplemental Guidance: The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with the Federal
Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and associated security
controls into the organization’s enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are
addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly related
to the organization’s mission/business processes. This process of security requirements integration also
embeds into the enterprise architecture, an integral information security architecture consistent with
organizational risk management and information security strategies. For PM-7, the information security
architecture is developed at a system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the
organizational information systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level
representing an individual information system but at the same time, is consistent with the information
security architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration are
most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting
security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology provides guidance on
integrating information security requirements and security controls into enterprise architectures. Related
controls: PL-2, PL-8, PM-11, RA-2, SA-3.
Data collected in support of the Information Security Program, primarily the security
requirements and controls required for security authorization [CA-6] and life cycle support
[SA-3] are integrated into the organization’s enterprise architecture to ensure security
considerations are addressed by the organization early in the system development life cycle
and that the requirements and controls assigned are directly and explicitly related to the
organization’s mission/business processes.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-39.
PM-8 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN
Control: The organization addresses information security issues in the development, documentation, and
updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan.
Supplemental Guidance: Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and resources.
The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure and key resources and for preparing an
associated critical infrastructure protection plan are found in applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related controls: PM-1, PM-9, PM-11, RA-3.
Identifying and documenting critical infrastructure and key resources provides the
organization with the fundamental understanding of what assets need protection, at what
level, ensures focus on the mission/business objectives, and supports contingency planning
[CP-2]
Control Enhancements: None.

PM-9 RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Control: The organization:
Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of information systems;
a. Chapter 3-PM PAGE 3-303
b. c. Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and
Reviews and updates the risk management strategy at least annually or as required, to address
organizational changes.
Supplemental Guidance: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an
unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment
methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the organization
with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk over time. The use of a
risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide application of the risk management
strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can be informed by risk-related inputs from
other sources both internal and external to the organization to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and
comprehensive. Related control: RA-3.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. b. c. PM-10 SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS
Control: The organization:
Manages (i.e., documents, tracks, and reports) the security state of organizational information systems
and the environments in which those systems operate through security authorization processes;
Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational risk
management process; and
Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an organization-wide risk management
program.
Supplemental Guidance: Security authorization processes for information systems and environments of
operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process, a Risk
Management Framework, and associated security standards and guidelines. Specific roles within the risk
management process include an organizational risk executive (function) and designated authorizing
officials for each organizational information system and common control provider. Security authorization
processes are integrated with organizational continuous monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing
understanding and acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. Related control: CA-6.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: NIST Special Publications 800-37, 800-39.
a. b. PM-11 MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION
Control: The organization:
Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the resulting risk to
organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and
Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes and
revises the processes as necessary, until achievable protection needs are obtained.
Supplemental Guidance: Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to
counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e.,
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the
mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the
stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection needs determine the
required security controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the
mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an organization’s information protection needs is an
understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The
Chapter 3-PM PAGE 3-304
security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business
process definitions and associated information protection requirements are documented by the organization
in accordance with organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7, PM-8, RA-2.
Identifying and defining the organization’s mission/business processes is required in order to
identify critical infrastructures and key resources, and in turn the organization’s operations,
assets, and individuals that may be at risk, which determines the information protection needs
based on the level of adverse impact if a compromise of information occurs. Security
categorization describes the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations,
organizational assets, and individuals should the information and information system be
compromised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability and results in a
potential impact level of low, moderate, or high, which indicates the set of protection needs
required. Reference Section 2 of this document and [RA-2].
Control Enhancements: None.

PM-12 INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM
Control: The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat
incident handling team.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive Order
13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat programs. The standards and
guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively
to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider
threat programs include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the
centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential
insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the
responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized
integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency
insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual
employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training
to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human
resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology, information system security,
and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department/agency
insider threat posture.
Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may already
have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially
important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often
preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and
conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform and guide
organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is
important to ensure that all monitoring activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation,
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Related controls: AC-6, AT-2, AU-6, AU-7,
AU-10, AU-12, AU-13, CA-7, IA-4, IR-4, MP-7, PE-2, PS-3, PS-4, PS-5, PS-8, SC-7, SC-38, SI-4, PM-1,

PM-13 INFORMATION SECURITY WORKFORCE
Control: The organization establishes an information security workforce development and improvement
program.
Supplemental Guidance: Information security workforce development and improvement programs include, for
example: (i) defining the knowledge and skill levels needed to perform information security duties and
tasks; (ii) developing role-based training programs for individuals assigned information security roles and
responsibilities; and (iii) providing standards for measuring and building individual qualifications for
incumbents and applicants for information security-related positions. Such workforce programs can also
include associated information security career paths to encourage: (i) information security professionals to
advance in the field and fill positions with greater responsibility; and (ii) organizations to fill information
security-related positions with qualified personnel. Information security workforce development and
improvement programs are complementary to organizational security awareness and training programs.
Information security workforce development and improvement programs focus on developing and
institutionalizing core information security capabilities of selected personnel needed to protect
organizational operations, assets, and individuals. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3.
Examples:
Privileged users have a working knowledge of system functions, security policies, technical
security safeguards, and operational security measures. DoD has implemented its Workforce
Improvement Program through DoD 8570.01-M and its follow-on DoDD 8140.01.
Organizations must ensure that individuals responsible for performing maintenance on
accounts (e.g., account manager) have direction on who is able to make decisions about the
different types of accounts directed in AC-2.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. b. PM-14 TESTING, TRAINING, AND MONITORING
Control: The organization:
Implements a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting security testing, training,
and monitoring activities associated with organizational information systems:
1. Are developed and maintained; and
2. Continue to be executed in a timely manner;
Reviews testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the organizational risk
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control ensures that organizations provide oversight for the security testing,
training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide and that those activities are coordinated.
With the importance of continuous monitoring programs, the implementation of information security across
the three tiers of the risk management hierarchy, and the widespread use of common controls, organizations
coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring activities that are routinely conducted as part of
ongoing organizational assessments supporting a variety of security controls. Security training activities,
while typically focused on individual information systems and specific roles, also necessitate coordination
across all organizational elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by
current threat and vulnerability assessments. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, SI-4.
Control Enhancements: None.

Chapter 3-PM PAGE 3-306
PM-15 a. b. c. CONTACTS WITH SECURITY GROUPS AND ASSOCIATIONS
Control: The organization establishes and institutionalizes contact with selected groups and associations
within the security community:
To facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational personnel;
To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies; and
To share current security-related information including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.
Supplemental Guidance: Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount importance in
an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Security groups and associations include, for
example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news groups, and/or peer groups of
security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select groups and associations based on
organizational missions/business functions. Organizations share threat, vulnerability, and incident
information consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, and guidance. Related control: SI-5.
A number of venues are available to organizational personnel to facilitate ongoing security
education, awareness and training. These include, for example:
• System Administration, Networking, and Security (SANS) Institute.
• Conferences such as the DoD IA Conference.
• Contractor SAP Security Working Group (CSSWG).
IA and Computer Network Defense (CND) personnel and Service CISOs will maintain
contact with sponsoring agency/organization’s IA office to stay up to date with the latest
security policies, practices, techniques, and technologies. This information will be further
disseminated as required.
Control Enhancements: None.

PM-16 THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
Control: The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization
information-sharing capability.
Supplemental Guidance: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that adversaries may
successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of the best techniques to
address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This can include, for example, sharing
threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that
organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications
and warnings about threats that are likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g.,
government-commercial cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g.,
organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring
special agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared. Related controls: PM-12, PM-16.

Table 3-5: Privacy Control Families and Identifiers
FAMILY: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
This family ensures that organizations: (i) identify the legal bases that authorize a particular
personally identifiable information (PII) collection or activity that impacts privacy; and (ii)
specify in their notices the purpose(s) for which PII is collected.
AP-1 AUTHORITY TO COLLECT
Control: The organization determines and documents the legal authority that permits the collection, use,
maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII), either generally or in support of a
specific program or information system need.
Supplemental Guidance: Before collecting PII, the organization determines whether the contemplated
collection of PII is legally authorized. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel regarding the authority of any program or
activity to collect PII. The authority to collect PII is documented in the System of Records Notice (SORN)
and/or Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or other applicable documentation such as Privacy Act Statements
or Computer Matching Agreements. Related controls: AR-2, DM-1, TR-1, TR-2.
Control Enhancements: None.

AP-2 PURPOSE SPECIFICATION
Control: The organization describes the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable information (PII) is
collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices.
Supplemental Guidance: Often, statutory language expressly authorizes specific collections and uses of PII.
When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations ensure, in
consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal
counsel, that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any specific collection of PII.
Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly described in the related privacy
compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of
Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements provided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms
organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order to avoid unauthorized collections or uses of PII,
personnel who handle PII receive training on the organizational authorities for collecting PII, authorized
uses of PII, and on the contents of the notice. Related controls: AR-2, AR-4, AR-5, DM-1, DM-2, TR-1,

FAMILY: ACCOUNTABILITY, AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT
This family enhances public confidence through effective controls for governance,
monitoring, risk management, and assessment to demonstrate that organizations are
complying with applicable privacy protection requirements and minimizing overall privacy
risk.
a. b. c. AR-1 GOVERNANCE AND PRIVACY PROGRAM
Control: The organization:
Appoints a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) accountable for
developing, implementing, and maintaining an organization-wide governance and privacy program to
ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, maintenance,
sharing, and disposal of personally identifiable information (PII) by programs and information
systems;
Monitors federal privacy laws and policy for changes that affect the privacy program;
Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined allocation of budget and staffing] sufficient resources to
implement and operate the organization-wide privacy program;
Develops a strategic organizational privacy plan for implementing applicable privacy controls,
policies, and procedures;
Develops, disseminates, and implements operational privacy policies and procedures that govern the
appropriate privacy and security controls for programs, information systems, or technologies involving
PII; and
Updates privacy plan, policies, and procedures at least biennially.
d. e. f. Sufficient resources to meet AR-1.c are generally downward directed by service/agency or
corporate entities.
Supplemental Guidance: The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and privacy
program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection of individual
privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of an SAOP/CPO with the authority, mission,
resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy program. The SAOP/CPO,
in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and others as appropriate: (i) ensures the
development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and
responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII
holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations, and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors
privacy best practices; and (vi) monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.
To further accountability, the SAOP/CPO develops privacy plans to document the privacy requirements of
organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and supports resource requests by the
SAOP/CPO. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary depending upon the organizational
structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a
one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies, documentation, and controls already in place, such as
Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may
include a baseline of privacy controls selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting
privacy risk assessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy
training and awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for
eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance goals and
objectives for implementing identified privacy controls. Control Enhancements: None.

AR-2 a. b. PRIVACY IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Control: The organization:
Documents and implements a privacy risk management process that assesses privacy risk to
individuals resulting from the collection, sharing, storing, transmitting, use, and disposal of personally
identifiable information (PII); and
Conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems, programs, or other activities
that pose a privacy risk in accordance with applicable law, OMB policy, or any existing organizational
policies and procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycles of
all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and processes
for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. They include, but are not limited
to, the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document that is the outcome of that process.
OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of
the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on when PIAs are required for information systems.
Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities
involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted
to identify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that
programs or information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve
as notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring information
systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and are updated when
changes create new privacy risks.
Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 and Section 522 of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2005 require protection of PII. PII is defined [in CNSSI 4009] as
information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their
name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone or when combined with other
personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such
as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. When developing or procuring
information systems that collect, use, store, and/or disclose PII, potential privacy risks must
be identified and appropriate privacy controls implemented.
The SSP for the information system shall indicate whether the system “does” or “does not”
contain privacy information. If the information system contains privacy information, the ISO
must contact a DoD SAP cleared PII POC to determine PIA requirements in accordance with
OMB policy.
Control Enhancements: None.

AR-3 a. b. PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS
Control: The organization:
Establishes privacy roles, responsibilities, and access requirements for contractors and service
providers; and
Includes privacy requirements in contracts and other acquisition-related documents.
Supplemental Guidance: Contractors and service providers include, but are not limited to, information
providers, information processors, and other organizations providing information system development,
information technology services, and other outsourced applications. Organizations consult with legal
counsel, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and contracting
officers about applicable laws, directives, policies, or regulations that may impact implementation of this
control. Related control: AR-1, AR-5, SA-4.

AR-4 PRIVACY MONITORING AND AUDITING
Control: The organization monitors and audits privacy controls and internal privacy policy continuously to
ensure effective implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: To promote accountability, organizations identify and address gaps in privacy
compliance, management, operational, and technical controls by conducting regular assessments (e.g.,
internal risk assessments). These assessments can be self-assessments or third-party audits that result in
reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and information systems. In addition to
auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls identified in this appendix, organizations
assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed privacy considerations into the life cycle of
personally identifiable information (PII), programs, information systems, mission/business processes, and
technology; (ii) monitor for changes to applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track
programs, information systems, and applications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv)
ensure that access to PII is only on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and
used only for the legally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s).
Organizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of PII; (ii)
perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess contractor compliance
with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified as part of the assessment
process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The organization Senior Agency
Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) coordinates monitoring and auditing efforts with
information security officials and ensures that the results are provided to senior managers and oversight
officials. Related controls: AR-6, AR-7, AU-1, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-12, CA-7, TR-1, UL-2.

a. b. c. AR-5 PRIVACY AWARENESS AND TRAINING
Control: The organization:
Develops, implements, and updates a comprehensive training and awareness strategy aimed at ensuring
that personnel understand privacy responsibilities and procedures;
Administers basic privacy training at least annually and targeted, role-based privacy training for
personnel having responsibility for personally identifiable information (PII) or for activities that
involve PII at least annually; and
Ensures that personnel certify (manually or electronically) acceptance of responsibilities for privacy
requirements at least annually.
Supplemental Guidance: Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the
organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically focus on
broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government Act of 2002 and the
consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify new privacy risks, how to
mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents. Privacy training may also target data
collection and use requirements identified in public notices, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or
System of Records Notices (SORNs) for a program or information system. Specific training methods may
include: (i) mandatory annual privacy awareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal
privacy program websites; (iv) manuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g.,

AR-6 PRIVACY REPORTING
Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and updates reports to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), Congress, and other oversight bodies, as appropriate, to demonstrate accountability with
specific statutory and regulatory privacy program mandates, and to senior management and other personnel
with responsibility for monitoring privacy program progress and compliance.
Supplemental Guidance: Through internal and external privacy reporting, organizations promote
accountability and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting also helps organizations to
determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy controls, compare
performance across the federal government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in policy and implementation,
and identify success models. Types of privacy reports include: (i) annual Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP) reports to OMB; (ii) reports to Congress required by the Implementing Regulations of the
9/11 Commission Act; and (iii) other public reports required by specific statutory mandates or internal
policies of organizations. The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy
Officer (CPO) consults with legal counsel, where appropriate, to ensure that organizations meet all
applicable privacy reporting requirements.

AR-7 PRIVACY-ENHANCED SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Control: The organization designs information systems to support privacy by automating privacy controls.
Supplemental Guidance: To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems,
organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the collection,
use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into
system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, thereby reducing the likelihood
of information system breaches and other privacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic
reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the
organization’s privacy policy. Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed,
organizations regularly monitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is
consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of
organizations, or in a manner compatible with those purposes. Related controls: AC-6, AR-4, AR-5, DM-2,

a. b. AR-8 ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES
Control: The organization:
Keeps an accurate accounting of disclosures of information held in each system of records under its
control, including:
(1) Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record; and
(2) Name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made;
Retains the accounting of disclosures for the life of the record or five years after the disclosure is
made, whichever is longer; and
Makes the accounting of disclosures available to the person named in the record upon request.
Supplemental Guidance: The Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
periodically consults with managers of organization systems of record to ensure that the required
accountings of disclosures of records are being properly maintained and provided to persons named in
those records consistent with the dictates of the Privacy Act. Organizations are not required to keep an
accounting of disclosures when the disclosures are made to individuals with a need to know, are made
pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or are made to a law enforcement agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
§ 552a(c)(3). Heads of agencies can promulgate rules to exempt certain systems of records from the
requirement to provide the accounting of disclosures to individuals. Related control: IP-2.

FAMILY: DATA QUALITY AND INTEGRITY
This family enhances public confidence that any personally identifiable information (PII)
collected and maintained by organizations is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for the
purpose for which it is to be used, as specified in public notices.
a. b. c. d. DI-1 DATA QUALITY
Control: The organization:
Confirms to the greatest extent practicable upon collection or creation of personally identifiable
information (PII), the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of that information;
Collects PII directly from the individual to the greatest extent practicable;
Checks for, and corrects as necessary, any inaccurate or outdated PII used by its programs or systems
at least every 180 days; and
Issues guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of
disseminated information.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance of PII.
Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into
information systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces
(API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the PII,
how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to validate the accuracy of PII that is used to
make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be
more comprehensive than those used to validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to
validate PII that is obtained from sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of
individuals.
When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a taxpayer’s
income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information systems and
develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be
updated. Related controls: AP-2, DI-2, DM-1, IP-3, SI-10.
Control Enhancements:
(1) (2) DATA QUALITY | VALIDATE PII

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations conducting or participating in Computer Matching Agreements with
other organizations regarding applicants for and recipients of financial assistance or payments under federal
benefit programs or regarding certain computerized comparisons involving federal personnel or payroll
records establish a Data Integrity Board to oversee and coordinate their implementation of such matching
agreements. In many organizations, the Data Integrity Board is led by the Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO). The Data Integrity Board ensures that controls are in place
to maintain both the quality and the integrity of data shared under Computer Matching Agreements.

of records or a system of records with nonfederal records for the purpose of establishing or verifying the eligibility of, or
continuing compliance with, statutory and regulatory requirements by, applicants for, recipients or beneficiaries of, participants
in, or providers of services with respect to cash or in-kind assistance or payments under federal benefit programs or computerized
comparisons of two or more automated federal personnel or payroll systems of records or a system of federal personnel or payroll
records with nonfederal records. See Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (a)(8)(A).

FAMILY: DATA MINIMIZATION AND RETENTION
This family helps organizations implement the data minimization and retention requirements to
collect, use, and retain only personally identifiable information (PII) that is relevant and
necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected. Organizations retain PII for only
as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) specified in public notices and in accordance with
a National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)-approved record retention schedule.
DM-1 a. b. c. MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Control: The organization:
Identifies the minimum personally identifiable information (PII) elements that are relevant and
necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection;
Limits the collection and retention of PII to the minimum elements identified for the purposes
described in the notice and for which the individual has provided consent; and
Conducts an initial evaluation of PII holdings and establishes and follows a schedule for regularly
reviewing those holdings at least annually to ensure that only PII identified in the notice is collected
and retained, and that the PII continues to be necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is consistent
with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements required to support a
specific organization business process may be a subset of the PII the organization is authorized to collect.
Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII elements required by the information system or activity to
accomplish the legally authorized purpose.
Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory of PII,
where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an initial review and
subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that such
holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations are also directed by OMB to reduce
their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper performance of a documented organizational
business purpose. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to develop and publicize, either
through a notice in the Federal Register or on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their
holdings to supplement the initial review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to
ensure that reductions in organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules.
By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only the data
specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for the purpose(s)
specified in the notice. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-4, IP-1, SE-1, SI-12, TR-1.
Control Enhancements:
(1) MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION | LOCATE / REMOVE / REDACT / ANONYMIZE PII
The organization, where feasible and within the limits of technology, locates and removes/redacts specified PII
and/or uses anonymization and de-identification techniques to permit use of the retained information while reducing
its sensitivity and reducing the risk resulting from disclosure.
Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-122 provides guidance on anonymization.

DM-2 DATA RETENTION AND DISPOSAL
Control: The organization:
Chapter 3-Privacy PAGE 3-316
a. b. c. Retains each collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for in accordance with National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to fulfill the purpose(s) identified in the notice or as
required by law;
Disposes of, destroys, erases, and/or anonymizes the PII, regardless of the method of storage, in
accordance with a NARA-approved record retention schedule and in a manner that prevents loss, theft,
misuse, or unauthorized access; and
Uses [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or methods] to ensure secure deletion or
destruction of PII (including originals, copies, and archived records).
Supplemental Guidance: NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal records.
Program officials coordinate with records officers and with NARA to identify appropriate retention periods
and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than is operationally needed.
In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice. Methods of storage include, for
example, electronic, optical media, or paper.
Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g., delete
Social Security numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period for PII that is
maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this effort is undertaken in
consultation with an organization’s records officer to receive NARA approval). In both examples,
organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records Notice) to inform the public of any
changes in holdings of PII.
Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche, may not permit the
removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained on such media.
Related controls: AR-4, AU-11, DM-1, MP-1, MP-2, MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-6, MP-7, MP-8, SI-12, TR-

Control: The organization:
Develops policies and procedures that minimize the use of personally identifiable information (PII) for
testing, training, and research; and
Implements controls to protect PII used for testing, training, and research.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information systems prior to
deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training. The use of PII in testing,
research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the information. If PII must be
used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated risks and to authorize the use of and limit the
amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations consult with the SAOP/CPO and legal counsel to ensure
that the use of PII in testing, training, and research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was
collected.

FAMILY: INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION AND REDRESS
This family addresses the need to make individuals active participants in the decision-making
process regarding the collection and use of their personally identifiable information (PII). By
providing individuals with access to PII and the ability to have their PII corrected or amended,
as appropriate, the controls in this family enhance public confidence in organizational decisions
made based on the PII.
a. b. c. d. IP-1 CONSENT
Control: The organization:
Provides means, where feasible and appropriate, for individuals to authorize the collection, use,
maintaining, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) prior to its collection;
Provides appropriate means for individuals to understand the consequences of decisions to approve or
decline the authorization of the collection, use, dissemination, and retention of PII;
Obtains consent, where feasible and appropriate, from individuals prior to any new uses or disclosure
of previously collected PII; and
Ensures that individuals are aware of and, where feasible, consent to all uses of PII not initially
described in the public notice that was in effect at the time the organization collected the PII.
Supplemental Guidance: Consent is fundamental to the participation of individuals in the decision-making
process regarding the collection and use of their PII and the use of technologies that may increase risk to
personal privacy. To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate notice of the purposes of
the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to consent to the activity. Organizations
tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet operational needs. Organizations achieve
awareness and consent, for example, through updated public notices.
Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is the
preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative action to
allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an individual to click a
radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast, opt-out requires individuals to
take action to prevent the new or continued collection or use of such PII. For example, the Federal Trade
Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing
calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied consent is the least preferred method and should be used in
limited circumstances. Implied consent occurs where individuals’ behavior or failure to object indicates
agreement with the collection or use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has
been posted that security cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording).
Depending upon the nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow
individuals to limit the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent
mechanisms include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII.
Consequences can vary from organization to organization. Related controls: AC-2, AP-1, TR-1, TR-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1) CONSENT | MECHANISMS SUPPORTING ITEMIZED OR TIERED CONSENT
The organization implements mechanisms to support itemized or tiered consent for specific uses of data.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can provide, for example, individuals’ itemized choices as to
whether they wish to be contacted for any of a variety of purposes. In this situation, organizations
construct consent mechanisms to ensure that organizational operations comply with individual choices.

a. b. c. d. IP-2 INDIVIDUAL ACCESS
Control: The organization:
Provides individuals the ability to have access to their personally identifiable information (PII)
maintained in its system(s) of records;
Publishes rules and regulations governing how individuals may request access to records maintained in
a Privacy Act system of records;
Publishes access procedures in System of Records Notices (SORNs); and
Adheres to Privacy Act requirements and OMB policies and guidance for the proper processing of
Privacy Act requests.
Supplemental Guidance: Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within
organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to data.
Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal requirements,
or other factors. The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request processing, in consultation with
legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate, however, and heads of agencies
may promulgate rules exempting particular systems from the access provision of the Privacy Act. In
addition, individuals are not entitled to access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil
action or proceeding. Related controls: AR-8, IP-3, TR-1, TR-2.
Control Enhancements: None.

a. b. IP-3 REDRESS
Control: The organization:
Provides a process for individuals to have inaccurate personally identifiable information (PII)
maintained by the organization corrected or amended, as appropriate; and
Establishes a process for disseminating corrections or amendments of the PII to other authorized users
of the PII, such as external information-sharing partners and, where feasible and appropriate, notifies
affected individuals that their information has been corrected or amended.
Supplemental Guidance: Redress supports the ability of individuals to ensure the accuracy of PII held by
organizations. Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data quality
especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate decisions or denial
of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in determining if records are to be
corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the changes sought, and the impact of the
changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and have incorrect information amended, where
appropriate.
To provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII collection;
(ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for requesting access to records;
(iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or amendment; (iv) implement resources to
analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of correcting or amending data collections; and (vi)
review any decisions that may have been the result of inaccurate information.
Organizational redress processes provide responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for
correction or amendment, including the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual objections
to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting organizational reviews of the initial
determinations. Where PII is corrected or amended, organizations take steps to ensure that all authorized
recipients of that PII are informed of the corrected or amended information. In instances where redress
involves information obtained from other organizations, redress processes include coordination with
organizations that originally collected the information. Related controls: IP-2, TR-1, TR-2, UL-2.

IP-4 COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization implements a process for receiving and responding to complaints, concerns, or
questions from individuals about the organizational privacy practices.
Supplemental Guidance: Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as a valuable source
of external input that ultimately improves operational models, uses of technology, data collection practices,
and privacy and security safeguards. Organizations provide complaint mechanisms that are readily
accessible by the public, include all information necessary for successfully filing complaints (including
contact information for the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) or
other official designated to receive complaints), and are easy to use. Organizational complaint management
processes include tracking mechanisms to ensure that all complaints received are reviewed and
appropriately addressed in a timely manner. Related controls: AR-6, IP-3.

FAMILY: SECURITY
This family supplements the security controls in Appendix F to ensure that technical, physical,
and administrative safeguards are in place to protect personally identifiable information (PII)
collected or maintained by organizations against loss, unauthorized access, or disclosure, and
to ensure that planning and responses to privacy incidents comply with OMB policies and
guidance. The controls in this family are implemented in coordination with information security
personnel and in accordance with the existing NIST Risk Management Framework.
SE-1 a. b. INVENTORY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Control: The organization:
Establishes, maintains, and updates at least annually an inventory that contains a listing of all
programs and information systems identified as collecting, using, maintaining, or sharing personally
identifiable information (PII); and
Provides each update of the PII inventory to the CIO or information security official at least annually
to support the establishment of information security requirements for all new or modified information
systems containing PII.
Supplemental Guidance: The PII inventory enables organizations to implement effective administrative,
technical, and physical security policies and procedures to protect PII consistent with Appendix F, and to
mitigate risks of PII exposure. As one method of gathering information for their PII inventories,
organizations may extract the following information elements from Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) for
information systems containing PII: (i) the name and acronym for each system identified; (ii) the types of
PII contained in that system; (iii) classification of level of sensitivity of all types of PII, as combined in that
information system; and (iv) classification of level of potential risk of substantial harm, embarrassment,
inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals, as well as the financial or reputational risks to
organizations, if PII is exposed. Organizations take due care in updating the inventories by identifying
linkable data that could create PII. Related controls: AR-1, AR-4, AR-5, AT-1, DM-1, PM-5.

a. b. SE-2 PRIVACY INCIDENT RESPONSE
Control: The organization:
Develops and implements a Privacy Incident Response Plan; and
Provides an organized and effective response to privacy incidents in accordance with the
organizational Privacy Incident Response Plan.
Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in Appendix F, which concerns a
broader range of incidents affecting information security, this control uses the term Privacy Incident to
describe only those incidents that relate to personally identifiable information (PII). The organization
Privacy Incident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the SAOP/CPO. The plan includes: (i)
the establishment of a cross-functional Privacy Incident Response Team that reviews, approves, and
participates in the execution of the Privacy Incident Response Plan; (ii) a process to determine whether
notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and to provide that notice
accordingly; (iii) a privacy risk assessment process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment,
inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and, where appropriate, to take steps to mitigate any
such risks; (iv) internal procedures to ensure prompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy
incident to information security officials and the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy
Officer (CPO), consistent with organizational incident management structures; and (v) internal procedures
for reporting noncompliance with organizational privacy policy by employees or contractors to appropriate
Chapter 3-Privacy PAGE 3-322
management or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to provide notice
to oversight organizations in the event of a breach. Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy
Incident Response Plans with Security Incident Response Plans, or keep the plans separate. Related

FAMILY: TRANSPARENCY
This family ensures that organizations provide public notice of their information practices and
the privacy impact of their programs and activities.
a. b. c. TR-1 PRIVACY NOTICE
Control: The organization:
Provides effective notice to the public and to individuals regarding: (i) its activities that impact
privacy, including its collection, use, sharing, safeguarding, maintenance, and disposal of personally
identifiable information (PII); (ii) authority for collecting PII; (iii) the choices, if any, individuals may
have regarding how the organization uses PII and the consequences of exercising or not exercising
those choices; and (iv) the ability to access and have PII amended or corrected if necessary;
Describes: (i) the PII the organization collects and the purpose(s) for which it collects that information;
(ii) how the organization uses PII internally; (iii) whether the organization shares PII with external
entities, the categories of those entities, and the purposes for such sharing; (iv) whether individuals
have the ability to consent to specific uses or sharing of PII and how to exercise any such consent; (v)
how individuals may obtain access to PII; and (vi) how the PII will be protected; and
Revises its public notices to reflect changes in practice or policy that affect PII or changes in its
activities that impact privacy, before or as soon as practicable after the change.
Supplemental Guidance: Effective notice, by virtue of its clarity, readability, and comprehensiveness, enables
individuals to understand how an organization uses PII generally and, where appropriate, to make an
informed decision prior to providing PII to an organization. Effective notice also demonstrates the privacy
considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its information practices. The
organization may provide general public notice through a variety of means, as required by law or policy,
including System of Records Notices (SORNs), Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), or in a website
privacy policy. As required by the Privacy Act, the organization also provides direct notice to individuals
via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that
can be retained by the individuals.
The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is responsible
for the content of the organization’s public notices, in consultation with legal counsel and relevant program
managers. The public notice requirement in this control is satisfied by an organization’s compliance with
the public notice provisions of the Privacy Act, the E-Government Act’s PIA requirement, with OMB
guidance related to federal agency privacy notices, and, where applicable, with policy pertaining to
participation in the Information Sharing Environment (ISE).124
Changing PII practice or policy without prior
notice is disfavored and should only be undertaken in consultation with the SAOP/CPO and counsel.
Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-1, AR-2, IP-1, IP-2, IP-3, UL-1, UL-2.
124 The Information Sharing Environment is an approach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security
information. The ISE was established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law
108-458, 118 Stat. 3638. See the ISE website at: http://www.ise.gov.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PRIVACY NOTICE | REAL-TIME OR LAYERED NOTICE
The organization provides real-time and/or layered notice when it collects PII.
Supplemental Guidance: Real-time notice is defined as notice at the point of collection. A layered notice
approach involves providing individuals with a summary of key points in the organization’s privacy
policy. A second notice provides more detailed/specific information.
References: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e)(3), (e)(4); Section 208(b), E-Government Act of
2002 (P.L. 107-347); OMB Memoranda 03-22, 07-16, 10-22, 10-23; ISE Privacy Guidelines.
Chapter 3-Privacy PAGE 3-324
TR-2 a. c. SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICES AND PRIVACY ACT STATEMENTS
Control: The organization:
Publishes System of Records Notices (SORNs) in the Federal Register, subject to required oversight
processes, for systems containing personally identifiable information (PII);
b. Keeps SORNs current; and
Includes Privacy Act Statements on its forms that collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained
by individuals, to provide additional formal notice to individuals from whom the information is being
collected.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII collected in a
system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as “a group of any records under the control of any
agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number,
symbol, or other identifier.” SORNs explain how the information is used, retained, and may be corrected,
and whether certain portions of the system are subject to Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or
national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements provide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to
collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is mandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the
PII is to be used; (iv) the intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences
of not providing all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally,
organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example, when
conducting telephone interviews or surveys). Related control: DI-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICES AND PRIVACY ACT STATEMENTS | PUBLIC WEBSITE PUBLICATION
The organization publishes SORNs on its public website.
References: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e)(3); OMB Circular A-130.
TR-3 a. b. DISSEMINATION OF PRIVACY PROGRAM INFORMATION
Control: The organization:
Ensures that the public has access to information about its privacy activities and is able to
communicate with its Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO); and
Ensures that its privacy practices are publicly available through organizational websites or otherwise.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ different mechanisms for informing the public about their
privacy practices including, but not limited to, Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records
Notices (SORNs), privacy reports, publicly available web pages, email distributions, blogs, and periodic
publications (e.g., quarterly newsletters). Organizations also employ publicly facing email addresses and/or
phone lines that enable the public to provide feedback and/or direct questions to privacy offices regarding
privacy practices. Related control: AR-6.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; Section 208, E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-
347); OMB Memoranda 03-22, 10-23.
Chapter 3-Privacy PAGE 3-325
FAMILY: USE LIMITATION
This family ensures that organizations only use personally identifiable information (PII) either
as specified in their public notices, in a manner compatible with those specified purposes, or as
otherwise permitted by law. Implementation of the controls in this family will ensure that the
scope of PII use is limited accordingly.
UL-1 INTERNAL USE
Control: The organization uses personally identifiable information (PII) internally only for the authorized
purpose(s) identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally authorized
purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices. These
steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training organizational personnel on the
authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy
Officer (CPO) and where appropriate, legal counsel, organizations document processes and procedures for
evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to assess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational
authorities. Where appropriate, organizations obtain consent from individuals for the new use(s) of PII.
Related controls: AP-2, AR-2, AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, IP-1, TR-1, TR-2.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (b)(1).
UL-2 a. b. c. d. INFORMATION SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES
Control: The organization:
Shares personally identifiable information (PII) externally, only for the authorized purposes identified
in the Privacy Act and/or described in its notice(s) or for a purpose that is compatible with those
purposes;
Where appropriate, enters into Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement, Letters of
Intent, Computer Matching Agreements, or similar agreements, with third parties that specifically
describe the PII covered and specifically enumerate the purposes for which the PII may be used;
Monitors, audits, and trains its staff on the authorized sharing of PII with third parties and on the
consequences of unauthorized use or sharing of PII; and
Evaluates any proposed new instances of sharing PII with third parties to assess whether the sharing is
authorized and whether additional or new public notice is required.
Supplemental Guidance: The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer
(CPO) and, where appropriate, legal counsel review and approve any proposed external sharing of PII,
including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for consistency with uses described in
the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed new instance of external sharing of PII is not
currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the
proposed external sharing is compatible with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing
is compatible, organizations review, update, and republish their Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs),
System of Records Notices (SORNs), website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include
specific descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Information-
sharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the information being
shared. Related controls: AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, AR-8, AP-2, DI-1, DI-2, IP-1, TR-1.
Control Enhancements: None.

APPENDIX C: SAP Security Control Baselines
The table that follows provides the security control selections for the DoD SAP Community and
for all information systems under the purview of the CA SAPCO. This table is to be used in
conjunction with information system security categorization to determine the baseline set of
security controls applicable to an information system. See [RA-2] for detailed information
pertaining to security categorization.
Security categorization results in the identification of the security impact level for each of the
three information system security objectives: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Security
impact levels are defined as low (L), moderate (M) or high (H) for each system security
objective. The table indicates the security controls associated with each impact level for
confidentiality, integrity and availability, shown as C, I, and A within the table heading. Security
controls not selected as part of any baseline contain no entries within the C, I, and A columns
and are included for reference and possible selection during the tailoring process. Security
controls with an “S” in the C, I, or A columns apply specifically to SAP systems.
Security controls shall be documented in the Security Controls Traceability Matrix (SCTM),
which can be created from the table below by deleting those columns associated with impact
levels that do not apply to the information system. This provides the baseline set of security
controls applicable to the information system which may require tailoring and/or supplementing
based on other factors such as the information system usage, information owner requirements or
the environment. This is especially true for tactical systems, standalone systems, embedded
systems and others. If a security control identified in the baseline set of controls is tailored out,
an explanation must be provided in the SCTM, describing the rationale as to why the control
does not apply or how it is satisfied by other mitigating factors. Security controls may also be
tailored in (i.e., added) as necessary.
The Classified Overlay column reflects the CNSSI 1253, Appendix F, Classified Overlay
selection and identifies those security controls that must be applied to the baseline for all
classified systems.
The Potentially Common/Inheritable column reflects those controls identified by CNSS as
having a potential for implementation as a common control. The final determination as to
whether a control is common (or hybrid) varies depending on the organization, mission, IS,
and/or environment.
Any changes to the baseline security control selections must be addressed in the SCTM and must
be approved by the Authorizing Official or designee (e.g., SCA).

APPENDIX D: Confidentiality Impact Level Flowchart
Appendix D-Confidentiality Impact Level Flowchart PAGE D-375
APPENDIX E: Definitions
Application Software program that performs a specific function directly for a user
and can be executed without access to system control, monitoring, or
administrative privileges. [CNSSI 4009]
Clearing Clearing is the process of eradicating the data on media before reusing
the media in an environment that provides an acceptable level of
protection for the data that was on the media before clearing. In
general, laboratory techniques allow the retrieval of information that
has been cleared, but normal operations do not allow such retrieval.
Closed Source Software (CSS) Also known as Proprietary software.
Commercial off-the-Shelf
(COTS) Software
Copyrighted or open source vendor software publicly available for
purchase.
Controlled Interface (CI) A boundary with a set of mechanisms that enforces the security
policies and controls the flow of information between interconnected
information systems. [CNSSI 4009]
Cross Domain Solution (CDS) A form of controlled interface that provides the ability to manually
and/or automatically access and/or transfer information between
different security domains. [CNSSI 4009]
Data Spill or Classified
Information Spillage
Classified data is spilled either onto an unclassified information system
or to an information system with a lower [or different] level of
classification [or access]. [CNSSI 4009] Also referred to as data
exfiltration – the unauthorized transfer of data from a system.
Denial of Service (DoS) or
Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS)
The prevention of authorized access to resources or the delaying of
time-critical operations. DDoS is a technique that uses numerous hosts
to perform the attack. [CNSSI 4009]
Event Any observable occurrence in a system and/or network. Events
sometimes provide indication that an incident is occurring. [CNSSI
4009]
Freeware Copyrighted software given away for free by the author. Although it is
available for free, the author retains the copyright and does not
distribute source code, so other people cannot market the software as
their own.
Government off-the-Shelf
(GOTS) Software
Software developed with government funds for government use.
Incident An assessed occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the
confidentially, integrity or availability of an information system; or the
information the system processes, stores, or transmits; or that
constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security
policies, security procedures or acceptable use policies.[CNSSI 4009]
Initial Denial Authority An official granted authority by the head of a DoD Component to
withhold records requested under the Freedom of Information Act.
Intellectual Property Creations of the mind such as musical, literary, and artistic works;
inventions; and symbols, names, images, and designs used in
commerce, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related
rights. Under intellectual property law, the holder of one of these
abstract properties has certain exclusive rights to the creative work,
commercial symbol, or invention by which it is covered.[CNSSI-4009]
Appendix E-Definitions PAGE E-376
Local Area Network (LAN) A group of computers and network devices connected together over a
relatively small geographic area. A LAN may be isolated – no
connections outside the system boundary or facility; or interconnected
to another system or LAN.
Mobile Device Mobile devices include portable computing and communications
devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers,
personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and
audio recording devices). [NIST SP 800-53 Rev4] See also Portable
Electronic Device (PED).
Nonce A time-varying value that has at most a negligible chance of repeating,
for example, a random value that is generated anew for each use, a
timestamp, a sequence number, or some combination of these. [NIST
SP 800-102] [See also CNSSI 4009 definition]
Non-persistent Information Any information not authorized to be stored within a facility, both
digital and non-digital. This includes ensuring that information
systems resident to a facility do not retain data locally after session
termination beyond what the facility is approved for. [See PE-1]
Open Source Software (OSS) The 16 October 2009 memorandum from the DoD CIO, "Clarifying
Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)" defines OSS is
defined as “software for which the human-readable source code is
available for use, study, re-use, modification, enhancement, and
redistribution by the users of that software.” The program source code
is generally developed as a community in which programmers improve
upon the code and share the changes.
See http://dodcio.defense.gov/OpenSourceSoftwareFAQ.aspx for more
details.
Organization Within this document the entity identified as ‘organization’ varies. It
refers to that element (government unit or company) to which the ISO
belongs unless handled at a higher echelon.
Portable Electronic Device
(PED)
Any non-stationary electronic apparatus with singular or multiple
capabilities of recording, storing, and/or transmitting data, voice,
video, or photo images. This includes but is not limited to laptops,
personal digital assistants, pocket personal computers, palmtops, MP3
players, cellular telephones, video cameras, and pagers.[CNSSI 4009]
Platform Information
Technology (PIT)
Platform IT refers to computer resources, both hardware and software,
that are physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in real time to the
mission performance of special purpose systems such as weapons,
training simulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment,
calibration equipment, equipment used in the research and
development of weapons systems, medical technologies, transport
vehicles, buildings, and utility distribution systems such as water and
electric. [DoD 8500.01E; DoDI 8580.1] Note: Do not choose this
definition unless your system is designated as a PIT.
Public Domain Software Software not protected by copyright laws of any nation that may be
freely used without permission of, or payment to, the creator, and that
carries no warranties from, or liabilities to the creator. [CNSSI 4009]
Appendix E-Definitions PAGE E-377
Security Enforcing Operating System (OS), access control applications, audit applications,
device control applications, second party applications that perform IA,
account management, anti-virus, firewall; capable of making changes
to the security substructure of the system: modifies a user’s account or
changes permissions on objects such as enforcing Discretionary access
Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Network Access
Control (NAC).
Security Non-interfering Does not enforce or support any aspect of the system security policy,
but due to its presence inside the security boundary, e.g., code running
a privileged hardware mode within the OS, risk is elevated.
Security Supporting Impacts a security process or procedures: e.g., software used to
perform technical review for Assured File Transfer (AFT); software
that is only used by privileged users of the system in the performance
of their duties; removing a backup server which may affect
availability; code or script that authenticates the user and determines
authorization.
Shareware Software distributed on the basis of an honor system. Most shareware
is delivered free of charge, but the author usually requests that the user
pay a small fee if they continue to use the program. By sending the
small fee, the user is registered with the producer who in turn provides
assistance and updates. Shareware is inexpensive because it is usually
produced by a single programmer and is offered directly to customers.
Thus, there is practically no packaging or advertising expenses. Note
that shareware differs from public-domain software in that shareware
is copyrighted and source code is not made available. This means that
the user cannot sell a shareware product as his/her own.
Standalone A standalone IS may include desktop, laptop, and notebook personal
computers, and any other hand-held electronic device containing
classified information. Standalone IS by definition are not connected
to any LAN or other type of network, i.e., peripherals allowed, but no
network interface card (NIC) in use, no protected distribution system
(PDS) in place, no additional computers connected.
State of the Practice The highest level of development at a particular time (especially the
present time; e.g., current incident response tools/techniques; current
intrusion detection tools, techniques, procedures).
System Types Examples include: LAN, WAN, standalone, CI, CDS, PIT, application
Unattended IS Components Discovery of unlocked active session without user present.
Unattended Processing Automated processes executed/running on a user’s behalf while no
users are physically present in the area/facility.
Unauthorized Access Any access that violates the stated security policy. [CNSSI 4009]
Unauthorized Disclosure An event involving the exposure of information to entities not
authorized access to the information. [CNSSI 4009]
Unauthorized Monitoring Any monitoring of an IS without written approval from security
authorities.
Unauthorized Software Software obtained through unofficial channels and installed without
proper approval.
Wide Area Network (WAN) Computer network that spans a relatively large geographical area.
