"IA-1: 
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
(a) Develops, documents, and disseminates to all personnel:
  1.  An identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
      management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
  2.  Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and
      associated identification and authentication controls; and

(b) Reviews and updates the current:
  1.  Identification and authentication policy at least annually; and
  2.  Identification and authentication procedures at least annually.

Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IA family. Policy and
procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

Control Enhancements: None.

FURTHER INFORMATION:

The control IA-1, Identification and Authentication Policy and Procedures, is a foundational security control under the NIST 800-53 framework. It requires organizations to develop, document, and manage a formal policy and corresponding procedures to govern the processes of identification and authentication. This control ensures consistency, accountability, and alignment with regulatory requirements in managing user identities and authenticating access to systems and data.

Key Points:
1. Policy Requirements:
Content: The policy must outline the purpose, scope, roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination across organizational entities, and compliance requirements.
Dissemination: The policy must be communicated to all relevant personnel to ensure understanding and adherence.

2. Procedures:
These are operational steps that support the implementation of the identification and authentication policy.
Procedures include how to apply associated controls (e.g., password management, multi-factor authentication).

3. Review and Update:
Both the policy and procedures must be reviewed at least annually to ensure they remain effective and align with organizational and regulatory changes.
Supplemental Guidance:

Purpose: Establishes a framework for consistent application of identification and authentication controls across the organization.

Integration: Policies and procedures may be part of a larger information security program, reducing the need for duplicative system-specific policies.

Risk Management Alignment: The organization's risk management strategy plays a critical role in shaping these policies and procedures.

Compliance Drivers: Policies and procedures must align with federal laws, directives, and standards like:

FIPS 201: Federal identity credentials.
NIST SP 800-12: Information security basics.
NIST SP 800-63: Digital identity guidelines.

Related Guidance:
PM-9 (Risk Management Strategy): Links identification and authentication policy with broader organizational risk management.

References for Implementation:
FIPS Publications and NIST Special Publications cited in the control provide detailed guidance on implementing identification and authentication systems.

Why This Control is Important:
(1) Proper identification and authentication are cornerstones of securing access to systems and data.
(2) Policies and procedures ensure consistency in implementing security measures, reduce vulnerabilities, and support compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
(3) Regular reviews keep the organization adaptive to evolving threats and technologies.
(4) By adhering to IA-1, organizations create a robust framework for managing identities and access in a secure, consistent, and compliant manner.
